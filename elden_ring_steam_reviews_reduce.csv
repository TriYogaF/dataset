"134238208,english,""I write this review as I have 100% completed Elden Ring. And yet, despite this, I still find new things every time I play the game.";;
;;
Elden Ring is an experience to say the least, and I won't be dramatic and say it is life changing but it feels like this is THE video game to play if you're ever going to play a game. It's immersive and full of story, every little thing is made with such refined detail that you can easily miss the little things. Everything feels so interconnected and it is so easy to get lost and find yourself on an adventure.;;
It's been a long time since I've felt like a game really wanted me to just... go explore and have fun with the world. It feels punishing but no punishment in this game goes unrewarded.;;
;;
Here's my breakdown of the game, I'll try not to spoil but I'll post spoiler warnings just in case.;;
;;
*Story*:;;
;;
As any Fromsoft game is, the world is vague and extremely open ended. Which can be a huge mess if done wrong but this is done entirely right. Story is not handed to you on a silver platter, however if you do wish to go find it through character storylines, you're given plenty of exposition and development. Characters are made to make you care about them or hate them. A lot.;;
Where Elden Ring shines is the characters that they weave into the story and how important bosses feel to kill due to story context. The context you are given bit by bit really sell your journey.;;
;;
*The Endings*:;;
;;
(I have not done Golden Mask or Dungeater's ending as they do not really interest me too much. Do note there are spoilers up ahead so skip this section if you don't want that);;
;;
-Ranni's Ending was actually one of the most satisfying endings to a Souls game I've seen in a long time. She was a compelling character and her roster of companions feel fun and diverse in their own ways. They take you on this meaningful journey with twists and questionable moral choices. And to wrap it all up nicely after taking you underground to Nokron, Fromsoft has you revisiting areas previously to ground you in Ranni's backstory via Liurnia.;;
I 100% recommend getting this ending and I'll be posting a guide soon!;;
;;
-Frenzy Flame Ending was... something? It wasn't exactly remarkable but I did really enjoy the voice acting! I can't say the way to get it was entertaining though, go through some sewers, comet azur Mohg, and take 5 minutes to jump on some graves and now you have an ending only 15% of people this game have. It didn't feel satisfying but it was visually neat and the eyes look really radical.;;
;;
-Elden Lord. Nuff said, you become elden lord. A decent neutral ending!;;
;;
-Fia's. This one was actually really mysterious and fun. Full of deceit and conflict. You don't get an achievement with this alas but it's worth doing. Fun bosses, neat story, Fia being based.;;
;;
;;
*Gameplay*;;
;;
It takes some getting used to. I grew up on the souls games and I am used to fast paced movements. But I really had to be patient with this one! Lots of delay which forces you to pay attention to the details of certain bosses. Also adding jumping in with some of the mechanics was really neat! Albeit a bit annoying from time to time (Cough, Godfrey, Cough).;;
;;
The dungeons and caves are plenty of fun and remind me of old legend of zelda mechanics. The bosses are fun and engaging, always on your toes. Although Rennala was a slight bore phase 1.;;
You can take your time or zoom through the Main Story. Going back to back in the story takes around 2-4 hours. But there's so much to do in the game that it might take you 100+ hours to even complete it.;;

;;
A vast arsenal, and chances are you can use the weapon you want to use because for most non unique weapons you can add weapon arts to them. These weapon arts increase damage/ let you choose what they scale with, and add a new ability onto them.;;
;;
Plenty of spells, and most of them all generally have their uses, some for insane cheese (Dragon rot breath, Comet Azur). The most frustrating thing about them, is that enemies input read to dodge your shots, so delaying and or just trying to get a quick hit will normally be futile. The counter to the enemy dodge, is to just do it again. For some reason they decided that the ai should only be able to dodge a certain amount of times.;;
;;
And leading on from my last point: Bows, I am doing a bow only build, it is painful to just have the game decide half of your shots aren't going to hit, and if you try to attack while a boss is channeling something, generally the bow will lock you out of dodging away. Unless you are using a composite bow/ a quick bow that has a dodge attack you will be hit if your not a mile away from the boss. Using a small bow to relieve these issues kind of suck, as they are only really useful for applying status effects and not damage. Though it is understandable that bows should be weaker, but when you compare them to mage/faith counter parts it feels rough.;;

Elden Ring is the best game I have ever played. Simple as that. This is an absolute masterpiece, challenging in all the right ways, an immersive world with a unique atmosphere that pulls you in, story bits that you can discover yourself, loads of hidden content that rewards exploration, epic boss fights, a perfect scaling of game difficulty with your learning curve, incredible graphics, incredible soundtrack, immense replay value, rewarding combat, deep RPG elements, a huge selection of very different armaments, spells and equipment.;;

"134230930,english,""This game is definitely a worthwhile playthrough for anyone who may take the slightest interest in this genre. Though, I must say this game's end game does not have the most polish when compared to the beginning of the game. Bosses are overly punishing and overly active. The philosophy of bosses seems to have been very muddied. Bosses with large health pulls will have attacks capable of nearly one-shotting any build that does not dump vigor. Most early-game bosses are challenging, but well made enough to be beaten at any point in the game depending on skill level. The later bosses are very different on the other hand. The over-aggressive nature of bosses and their habit to end combos just to immediately begin a new one before you can properly achieve a hit is an incredibly frustrating one. Leaving you to always be overly cautious in order to even get an attack in. Forcing the players to constantly be on the defensive and break the flow of combat creates a less interesting environment and gameplay loop. It seems like the developers decided to focus on making the bosses more """"challenging"""" rather than fun. Bosses being challenging is a perfectly fine mechanic and is fundamental to the franchise, but Elden Ring seems to tip the scales, several times, into the frustrating territory. Having to wait an entire Youtube Ad's length of time for a proper opening in a boss only to do minimal damage is just not a fun way to play the game. Spending several minutes whittling a massive health bar, only to be instantly killed by singular mistake is not a fun way to play a game. Bosses with small health pools that are incredibly punishing are completely fine and enjoyable challenges. Bosses with massive health pools that spend most of their time whittling you down for your mistakes over time are also completely fine and enjoyable. It's when the two are mixed, is when you create an overall frustrating experience. Do not get me wrong. I love this game and enjoyed the many hours I put into it, but the game's late game bosses make it a difficult choice to want to replay it. 7/10 game trapped in a 10/10 frame. I would love to see this game get a sequel that irons out the issues."",2023-03-07 10:33:05,True,1,0,True,False,False,67,2,4356,3837,4210,2023-03-07 12:58:24";;

Elden Ring is truly FromSoftware at its peak, while I love the Dark Souls games, I think Elden Ring's world and lore are by far my favorite. The characters all feel like they are moving towards their own goals, and you are just a pawn for most of them. By the end of the game you could accept your fate or align your goals among one of these many characters, or flip everything on its head for yourself. I think the endings for the game are very interesting, and investigating to learn the lore of the game for myself was very fun for me! The design of characters and bosses in this game is also very interesting, as some have strange connections to the lore that lead you to learning more as you examine and play. Some just make for good mysteries too, leading you to craft your own theories about things. While I hope we get more explanations for things in future DLC's I'm also fine with things remaining mysterious, as it allows everyone to keep their own theories about the game. Gameplay feels a lot smoother than the clunkiness of the other Souls games I've played too. As a heavy greatsword builder I've also never been happier with how easy it is to achieve the build you're going for. ;;
The soundtrack is also killer, as most souls games are when it comes to their tracks. Wandering the world had to be my favorite part of the game, whereas in other Souls game, trekking along can feel like a drag. ;;

"134217284,english,""Should you play Elden Ring?";;
;;
FromSoft and the Soulslike genre certainly have a strong, dedicated following, but maybe that's not you. Perhaps you've never played this kind of game before and you aren't sure if you can trust they hype. I humbly offer my perspective, as someone who entered the world of Elden Ring (hereafter referred to as the Lands Between) with absolutely no experience with other FromSoft games or the brutally unforgiving genre from which it arose.;;
;;
I finally took the leap and bought Elden Ring because I love exploring open worlds. Linear gameplay can be great, but there is something especially appealing to me about a huge world that I can wander through freely, especially those with a sword-and-sorcery aesthetic. From RuneScape and Guild Wars to the Elder Scrolls and The Witcher, just give me a sword, a bow, some spells, and a world to get lost in.;;
;;
Here was a new world to explore in the Lands Between, and please believe me when I say I was not disappointed. The Lands Between are at times beautiful, terrifying, breathtaking and disturbing. The world is vast, and it seemed that every time I thought I had explored it all, there was still another hidden area to unlock and explore. This amazing world seemed all the bigger, I think, because of how small I felt in it.;;
;;
I am just an average gamer, no slouch but nothing to brag about either. My early experience in the game involved dying (a lot) to very basic enemies. I crept slowly through every cave and dungeon, constantly on guard for wolves and imps waiting to jump out at me. When I encountered my first dungeon boss, I probably fought and died a hundred times, determined to beat it (not realizing at the time that I was just too weak, underleveled for the fight, and really should have moved on and come back later). It was frustrating, but I loved the world and I was determined to explore it all.;;
;;
So... should you play? It is an excellent game on many levels, and I can attest that it is accessible (with a learning curve) to gamers new to the genre. That said, I would only recommend Elden Ring if you have patience and can emotionally tolerate repeated failure. While the open world design offers more freedom to avoid the hardest fights until you've leveled up, there are still some very challenging enemies that can take multiple attempts to defeat. If getting killed by the same boss for the twentieth time might make you punch your screen, maybe look elsewhere.;;
;;
"But if you are willing to learn and grow from defeat, and especially if you love exploring vast new worlds, then I hope you take a chance and journey into the Lands Between.

"134212733,english,""It was super fun until post-capital. Then the game starts becoming an uninteresting slog for the next half of the game. All the area's after the Atlas plateau just kinda suck. The re-use of enemies/bosses become super apparent As many early game bosses become normal enemies in the late game which is super dis-jarring. Not to mention one of the main super important bosses (godrick) gets re-used in his first phase as an evergaol boss? That's just goofy as all can be. The game would've been a lot better if it was smaller for sure. As places like the mountaintop of giants and concentrated snowfields aren't fun to explore. Hell you can't even see in most of the snow fields to actually explore the area. Also. The haligree tree is genuinely such a pain in the arse. I had more trouble getting to melania then fighting her? I don't know. I just cannot reccomend this game as the last half is just not fun at all. Atleast a lot of the big bosses were fun.

Combat is tight and responsive, weapons have a weight that feels appropriate for their size. There are a variety of different builds, styles, and choices based on personal preference and skill.

The game stumbles a bit near the end especially with tuning on some fights, but even then has a few of my favorite fights that really help it get over the finish line as a top 5 all time for me. Dark Souls 1 had a similar issue with its post O&S content, and if I can forgive that, I can certainly forgive this one when it throws several of its best fights near the end. There's even a JRPG style super boss that anyone with any familiarity at all with the series is well aware of, given she tells you her name each of the hundreds of times she will kill you;;

"134205492,english,""As many have said, it's quite an adventure and definitely worth playing for souls fans and anyone who likes a true action rpg. It's certainly not a 10/10, but not for lack of content. In fact, the game would've benefited from a few features/areas being cut.";;
;;
There is easily a full game's worth of unique content here, looking at the scale of the world, the number of areas, weapons/spells, and bosses. However, a lot of the content is repeated to the extent that the game is the scope of 2 or 3 full games. So instead of a normal-sized game where everything is unique and has a purpose, the game has a lot of re-used content and is a bit bloated. So after the 80-ish hour mark, the scope of the game actually works against itself, in my opinion.;;
;;
The first 40 or 50  hours are sheer bliss and rival my best experiences playing almost any other game, but it falls off bit by bit as you explore more of the worlds areas, finding nearly identical catacombs or caves, consumables that just have a different coat of paint, the same ruined churches/enemies, and mini bosses that are re-used over and over with slight alterations or coupled with other enemies for increased challenge.;;
;;
enemy and item placement is generally fantastic, and i always felt like the developers were right next to me, watching me play and placing everything by hand. So even when the content is re-used, exploring is still pretty engaging because there are very few empty dead ends.;;
;;
"The overall narrative is intriguing, but any actual explanation of the characters/world/who you are/etc are pushed so far to the sidelines that my biggest bit of positive feedback on this front is that it doesn't get in the way of the experience. And I'm absolutely forced to mention that characters' names are just unbearably similar, I really have no idea what they were thinking here. They took so many liberties with the narrative that they seem to have said to themselves """"it's probably better if it just doesn't make any sense and leaves the world in a state of mystery."""" I'm not sure I agree.";;
;;
"I'm tempted to say that the core systems (that is, the combat, menus, and upgrades) are excellent, but honestly there are some big holes in the experience that I can't overlook. It's difficult to summarize, but certain aspects of the game are too obscure considering how critical they are to the whole of the experience. Magic is a great example, as summons, incantations, and sorcery and more are all handled differently and are obscure enough that I wouldn't blame players for skipping most of these mechanics entirely. Sorcery in particular involves finding a specific NPC in the world that is hidden in a copy-paste hole in the ground that could EASILY be overlooked given the size of the world. Summons are granted through the use of an item which is obtained through an NPC that only appears during one part of the game's day/night cycle (which influences very few other parts of the game afaik), and incantations require equipping and using """"seals,"""" which is not very obvious. All these things and more are likely explained/hinted at early in the experience but given how much is thrown at you, it's impossible for all of it to stick.";;
;;
"Although it's sort of magical how every game mechanic is veiled in an in-world name (Runes = XP, Ashes of War = special skills for weapons, """"Tears"""" are health flask upgrades, etc), this makes for a very, very laborious process of trying to figure out if an item is even important or not. Speaking of importance, consumables make up a lot of the loot in the game, and in a game where the biggest challenges is bosses which will regain all their health when you die, consumables seem meaningless to me. My first 5 attempts at the more difficult bosses will just be learning attack patterns.";;
;;
Crafting is pointless because you only craft one-time-use consumables which I've already stated that I find useless. Crafting should've been excluded entirely from the game but I'd guess it was left in as an additional incentive to explore/revisit ares of the map.;;
;;
'Questing' is executed poorly enough to be a considerable net negative on the experience. NPCs appear in different places seemingly at random and the world is simply too big for this too be acceptable, especially without a questlog of some sort. ;;
;;
"There are a few types of loot that I was always happy to find: Smithing Stones (used to upgrade weapons), Talismans (usually stat modifiers that can be easily swapped out to sort of re-spec your character on the fly), armaments/armor, and Runes. Every other bit of loot was almost always pointless and I would shrug and say to myself, """"well, exploring and killing enemies is its own reward. ";;
;;
Talismans are great and maybe one of my favorite systems in the game. XP and weapons/gear are pretty straightforward, as loot at least. Smithing Stones, however, change the game in an important way that I love and hate, and ultimately wish was different. Upgrading weapons means that you can stick to certain weapons long after they should be obsolete, which is good in that you can use your favorite weapons for most of the playthrough, but because some weapons are so much better in terms of DPS than others, i found myself using only 3 different weapons during 90% or more of my 160 hours. There are an insane number of interesting weapons, so it's a shame that I never saw a path to success by trying lots of different ones. Smithing stones are also a pain-point in that finding a specific 'level' of stone is required to upgrade each stage of the weapons' power. what this means, is that at times, A level 7 smithing stone may be more valuable than an 8 or 9, simply because your weapon's upgrade is gated at each level and you might have run out of 7's. Still, smithing stones are always an exciting find and make exploring fun.;;
;;
I'm not going to say much about the visuals;" in terms of asthetics the game is an easy 10/10. It's truly a breathtaking game and I can't count how many times I said to myself during my playtime """"wow. I've never seen anything like that before.""""";
;;
Audio is great, OST is pretty spectacular and the music always matches the tone of the situation it accompanies.;;
;;
Last thing I want to cover is bosses, which are sort of a mixed bag. I'm not surprised this is a big point of contention for the community; some of them are very fun once you get the hang of their moveset, while others are just simply too cruel and unfair to be enjoyable or satisfying once you've conquered them. Almost every boss requires carefully timed dodges and a mastery of stamina management and character building. That's fine. What really isn't fine is bosses reading player inputs to trigger attacks the exact moment you do something, bosses that track perfectly, forcing dodge rolls instead of just clever footwork, absurdly long combos, Multiple boss phases, incorrect or very sloppy hit boxes and one hit kills. A boss could have one or two of the above and still be a fair fight, but I'd say the majority of the main bosses (and quite a few of the minibosses) have most or all of those features. I'm not saying any of the bosses aren't possible with time and effort, I'm saying a lot of them aren't very fun. Given the various types of character builds, the length of the game, and the fact that co-op is potentially part of the experience, I think the devs erred on the side of making bosses too overpowered, unfair, or tedious. If fighting bosses was less common I might give this a pass, but such a large percent of my playtime was spent in boss encounters (often fighting a new boss immediately after beating a previous one), that I really just got tired of the experience and wanted it to end.;
;;
"Now, this review has mostly focused on the negative features of the game, but I think the positives more than make up for it. This is really a breathtaking epic experience that, despite being flawed, is definitely worth a recommendation. Game of the Year? Maybe. 10/10? nope."",2023-03-06 22:24:45,True,0,0,False,True,False,148,41,9726,3852,9726,2023-03-05 10:11:02";;

"134202824,english,""So many amazing things were achieved with Elden Ring, and although its undeniably a masterpiece and genius in terms of world building and design. There are significant issues that might ruin the game for a lot of the player base, especially on subsequent play-through's. ";;
;;
With the exception of Godrick being a near perfect boss in terms of gameplay and design aesthetic. The boss quality of Elden Ring doesn't match up to their previous titles, Dark Souls 3 notably. Pretty much every main story boss in the game has at least one attack or more that is unreactable or purely unfair, with the end game bosses being the biggest offenders. But I will say that even though this may be an issue in terms of game design, Elden Ring is probably the easiest game Fromsoft has made given all the resources that are offered to you in game.;;
;;
Upon first play-through, someone might not have a problem running through the many side dungeons in the game because the act of finding a secret in the world adds spectacle, but this also has to do with the fact that most players wont know that the layouts and enemies used in these dungeons are reused over and over again, with little nuance. The side dungeons in Elden Ring are basically just the chalice dungeons from Bloodborne but worse;" because Instead of getting something useful as a reward from a chalice dungeon like you would in Bloodborne, because of the extreme build diversity in Elden Ring, you are going to get something completely useless to your specific build ninety percent of the time. In addition to the side dungeons, certain bosses like the Ulcerated Tree Spirit are reused at least 10 times if you go through the trouble to find them all. Fromsoft has handled reusing bosses in the past very well but it isn't done well here. With all this in mind you might think that, """"Well maybe you're only SUPPOSED to have one good play-through."""". But this just isn't the case when you factor in the sheer number of different builds and weapons you can use and the fact it has a New Game + option.  ";
;;
Considering the many flaws this game has, it doesn't stop this game from being one of the best games I have ever played. And without any of these flaws, Elden Ring would be undeniably one of the best games ever made. But it might still be up there even with its flaws. ;;
;;
So maybe I just typed all of this out for zero reason.;;

"134183640,english,""Elden Ring, is my first-ever darksouls game. After spending a good 30 hours on it, I wrote this review to reflect on how I feel about it. The game is quite challenging, and I'm not even going to sugarcoat it. Despite its difficult progression, the game offers so much possibility and exploration with its beautiful views, that it just leaves me admiring it every once in a while. The fighting mechanics and hitboxes are an 11/10, I very much love the weapons and magical effects. The only thing I dislike about this game, would probably be horse parkour. Sometimes the spectral steed Torrent, loves to jump or walk a few extra steps and that really messes up attempting to get to the bottom or top of places.

"134176218,english,""Great game, maybe it's my souls bias. most bosses are fun ( mohg is kinda stupid with that phase 2 transformation which just forces you to heal, with no way of avoiding the damage. I would be fine with that if it just healed him, but the fact that it forces you to take damage with no way around it IMO is straight donkey cock.) there are a couple I have problems with, mad pumpkin is my favorite of all the bosses I have fought(But my actual favorite boss is melania, Phase 1 is a breeze. Sure the health regain is a tough punish to deal with but with patients its not that hard to dodge and weave around her. Phase 2 though was extremely hard[atleast for me] she was faster and the bloom got me way more than it should, my stupid ass just running into it. had to fight the camera lock sometimes cause she would fly off my screen.Probably took me around 30 attempts to kill the cretonne.) . The exploration is really fun and is what got me to spend so much time in the game, cool environments rewarding you for searching them thoroughly while having secrets and alternate paths for most of the venture. Don't have too much to say about the normal mobs the populate the world, due to the fact that I just run past them to go straight to the end of what ever dungeon or area I happen to be in. Just do not really feel rewarded fighting them, their pretty hollow. The story was fun to follow although a confusing mess since its open world and I had no straight linear path to follow. All in all considered I think this game sits at my 6th favourite in my list of games. ";;

The biggest flaw imo is the repeated assets. While the world and enemies are still diverse overall, if you explore everything you will notice some similar mini-dungeons and repeat enemies (most notable is when you see the same side/mini-boss again).

134153761,english,I'm not even really a souls guy but the last game that made me feel this way was Skyrim. The way there's literally always something just ahead to investigate. The way the reward for doing so isn't just a Korok seed or whatever (until it is, but then you read a note saying """"Why is it always mushroom?"""" and it *feels* like you were rewarded, even when you weren't). The way every individual region of the world is just teeming with art direction and high fantasy imagery. The way the enemy designs are so interesting you flirt with death just to see the whole moveset. The high number of equipment items that all look genuinely unique. ";;
;;
One of the things that turned me off about souls games in the past was that if I lost my souls I felt like I had to grind back through an area I already completed to get them back or I'd be underleveled for the boss. I've never once had that feeling in Elden Ring. In part because the spawns are a bit more forgiving (directly in front of a boss room, for example), but also because of the fundamental gameplay design changes that come from it being open world. I'd go into it, but I'd rather get back to playing.;;

Insane balancing issues, some annoying level and quest design, fucked up parkour, clunky movement, some boring and repeated bosses...;;

My enjoyment came not from combat, but the exploration and character building;;
It felt like everything I explored contributed to my strength, even though it didn't really;;

I only hit two walls:;;
- Margit, because I was severely unprepared and unskilled;;
- Malenia, counting 80 actual tries, the only time I broke my self imposed rules;;
;;
I put some restrictions on my run a little after Margit:;;
Solo, No summons, No consumables, No Rune Arcs, No guarding, Heavy affinity only;;
Even so, the game felt easy with my heaviest armor / STR only / Colossal Sword build;;
;;
Played the Grafted Sword for more than half of the game, and the other half was basically the Greatsword;;
I wanted to try other weapons, but those felt like they were the best options I had for my build;;
Smithing should have been more affordable to give room for experimentation;;
;;
The story went right above my head, I have no idea what was going on;;
I only knew I had to kill, and boy, did I kill;;
Only character I grew attached to was Hewg, the blacksmith, who I liked a lot for reasons unbeknownst to me;;

Killed all the bosses and saw the Ranni and Fractured endings;;
Failed most quests because wiki gaming sucks;;

This is first of all just a combat focused game, it's open world dark souls and it is what you would expect. There are no mini games, no towns, there's one little guild you run into and very rarely do you come across someone or something not hostile. Your traversal options are mostly being just grounded with the situational high jump being granted to you. You can't swim, fly, or glide. The game has A LOT of abilities and gear to collect, and it starts you off well with classes to go into and from there you can just start setting goals of what you want to tackle with guidance or experience. Playing blind can be a bit frustrating if you're exploring for rewards and not strictly for challenge because you may not find something that suits your class. The enemy variety is insane, there's also a lot of traps in this game inside dungeons, so check your surroundings. Also make sure you follow the tutorial all the way through to get the basics of the game unlocked, don't try to go gallivanting after you step out into the world, follow the light. The game has some balancing issues, magic is very strong, bleed is very strong. I never found much use for crafting, but I heard it's a bit helpful. The combat is sluggish compared to other action games and the enemy attacks are sometimes strangely fast and relentless as if they should be in Sekiro instead, trying to pick your moments with melee can be frustrating unless you use summons, which are also broken (especially mimic tear) because they distract the AI. Lastly, co-op in this game is a tragedy because people can invade you.;;

"134105769,english,""elden ring is elden mid";;
it’s not a flawed masterpiece or a rough diamond or whatever else the meme 2 hour video essays tell you, it’s just mid;;
DISCLAIMER: this is my second time playing this game, don't mind the hours, the first time i was doing the hand hook and eyepatch build;;
;;
>open world;;
probably the best aspect of this game by far, you just can never get tired of exploring the lands between;;
one complaint about the open world i often hear is that you often find yourself just traveling way too much from point a to point b, but i don’t see this as a negative, since the game’s beauty alone is enough to keep your attention ;;
legacy dungeons are also good but that’s been said a million times already ;;
however, even this kind of open world is not without flaws;;
;;
>copy paste;;
why does this game have 5 or so dungeon types?;;
no, i don’t want to explore yet another cave or a mine or some lazily copy pasted catacombs (sometimes with a chariot), but sometimes you have to, to get the smithing stones or that talisman you want;;
but it’s not just the dungeons that get copy pasted, bosses and enemies do too;;
"can you imagine my disappointment when i got to the mountaintops of giants and was like """"holy, this area is so beautiful, i wonder what kind of enemies i'll be fighting in here""""";;
can you imagine my face when i saw the caelid dogs, the caelid birds, the stormveil birds, the demi-humans, the bats, the marionettes, the hands, and the vulgar militiamen;;
a-at least zamor dudes became a normal enemy instead of a m-mini-boss, so it's at least ONE unique enemy tied to this area, r-right?;;
miyazaki, my brother in christ, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THESE ANNOYING BIRDS AND BATS AND DOGS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME, I’VE KILLED SO MANY OF THE DEFAULT SWORD/SPEAR SOLDIERS, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD MORE ENEMIES INTO THE GAME;;
NO, YOU CAN’T JUST PASTE OLD ENEMIES FROM OLD GAMES, YOU DID THAT TWICE IN ELDEN RING ALREADY WITH ASYLUM DEMON AND CAPRA DEMON;;
i am especially sick of the copy pasted dragons, erdtree avatars are at least fun to fight;;
ROT DRAGON, ICE DRAGON, NORMAL DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON 2;;
ALL OF THEM HAVE THE SAME MOVESET;;
this is a triple a game, just to remind you;;
edit: there is way more copy paste from previous titles as it turns out, just today i found out about red wolf of radagon having the same animations as sif and the death blight frogs;;
;;
>combat;;
this is where things get bad, such outdated souls-tier combat where it feels like you’re handling a bus instead of a human SHOULD NOT EXIST with such fast bosses that feel like they come straight out of sekiro;;
either make the player faster and give him more movement options, or make the bosses slower;;
it is infuriating having to dodge 5-10 boss attacks only to get ONE hit in and then repeat the cycle;;
torrent is awful to control, and it feels like he's not listening to half my commands;;
wow, it's just like a real horse!;;
the decision to make your stamina tied to torrent's is also bizarre and unexplainable;;
also, input buffering is more often then not the result of your character’s demise, as it has been countless times that this trash read my ash of war as ash of war + left handed attack after it and i died so many times because of this;;
before fromdrones shout “skill issue”, i am literally putting my hands off the keyboard after doing the ash of war and my character still does the normal attack after it;;
but, despite that, my character drinks only 1 flask half the time despite me mashing the heal button;;
i often miss the opportunity to reposte thanks to INPUT BUFFERING, so why not let the player know when the boss stagger is coming up?;;
you're gonna make a posture break mechanic without implementing at least some kind of sign?;;
i swear to christ miyazaki has never played his own games;;
also, why do the enemies' arrows home in on you, yet the player's arrows don't home in on enemies?;;
do the enemies have special magnet arrows or something?;;
can some lore expert tell me how this is explained in the story?;;
;;
>bosses;;
and these bosses, oh god, these bosses;;
delayed attacks, input reads (these are especially “fun” if you’re doing any run that involves projectiles), blatant destruction of established game mechanics, they got everything you don’t want in an action rpg;;
and i can't stress enough how awful the input reads are, the best bosses for showcasing such nonsense are margit for his combo extender that he won't do unless you attack and the godskins who shoot black flames at you IMMEDIATELY upon pressing the heal button;;
someone needs to teach miyazaki that's not how reaction time works;;
but, being completely honest, i had fun fighting malenia;;
sure, she is actually one to break established mechanics;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Vbsr3Ko7M;;
but at least that boss has a unique feel and dynamic to it, akin to an old samurai standoff, where the two warriors exchange blows and then fall back to circle around each other;;
her attacks are more or less intuitive, and she does have a flexible moveset that’s fun to play around with on your part;;
EXCEPT FOR WATERFOWL DANCE AND VAMPIRISM, WHOEVER DESIGNED THOSE INTO MALENIA NEEDS TO GET FIRED FROM THEIR JOB ASAP, AND UNLESS YOU’VE NOT DONE SOMETHING AS ELEMENTARY AS BEATING MALENIA ON A KEYBOARD WITH NO SUMMONS OR SLEEP POTS OR MOONVEIL/ROB, YOUR OPINION DOES NOT COUNT;;
also, elden beast is the worst final boss in any video game ever, radagon was such a good conclusion to this mediocre, but still charming game, but nope, my face gets smeared with the broken unfun mess that is elden beast;;
he's constantly running away, he's not at all dynamic like radagon, and he even looks like crap;;
come on, who wants to fight a giant space spaghetti as the final boss?;;
also, ulcerated tree spirit;;
just ulcerated tree spirit;;
;;
>story;;
average fromsoft fan be like:;;
OH MY SCIENCE IS THAT LE HECKING MIYAZAKI TELLING THE LORE OF THE GAME THROUGH ITEM DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 1488TH TIME??? HOLY GOSH OOOOOOOOOOO ELDEN RING;;
seriously though, the lore of this game is admittedly pretty interesting, but the narrative sucks;;
to give an example, in the beginning we are shown a literal powerpoint presentation about the world;;
okay, what’s the night of the black knives?;;
not gonna explain?;;
oh, okay;;
i’m a tarnished?;;
i don’t even understand what that means;;
what the hell is an elden ring?;;
and so on and so forth;;
stuff like this continues throughout the whole game because the narrative feels like a jumbled mess of in-universe terms and seemingly random events;;
on that note, quest design in this game is unintuitive as hell;;
to take varre’s quest for instance, how the hell am i supposed to know that i need invade other players THREE times to advance his quest?;;
or patches, it’s like he’s teleporting around the map at random, he doesn’t tell you where he’s gonna go;;
;;
>leveling;;
softcaps?;;
really?;;
at least tell the player when they get to them, so he doesn’t have to google it;;
i suggest this is due to pvp or some crap like that, but pvp is a portion of the game, not the entirety of it and you don’t balance stuff AROUND it;;
the smithing stone grind in this game is obnoxious because of what i described about the caves in the open world section;;
such game design is almost ubisoft-tier, and those are the items that actually get you through the game;;
;;
>optimization;;
it is just bad;;
it is understandable why my fps are bad on medium settings, seeing distant lands is part of the charm of this game;;
but the crashes are inexcusable;;
i suspect it is due to the botched anti-cheat, since without steam this game didn't run half as bad;;
;;
IN CONCLUSION;;
i really cannot recommend this game if you're into the ACTION part of the ACTION RPGs;;
it's a strong MAYBE if you're into the RPG part, but it's just simply so tiresome to even control your character;;
this game is just outdated, through and through, and i think we all know why it won goty;;
it is because there was nothing else better than elden ring;;
i mean, come on, you're gonna give it to god of soy?;;

"134105558,english,""Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!";;
;;
Here are the ingredients you will need!;;
;;
Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.;;
;;
Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.;;
;;
Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.;;
;;
;;
1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.;
;;
2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.;
;;
3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.;;
;;
4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.;;
;;
5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.;;
;;
6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.;;
;;
7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.;;
;;
8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.;;
;;
9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.;;

"134100850,english,""THE GOOD: ";;
;;
* New open world setting.;;
This works phenomenally, the change from the cramped and claustrophobic gauntlets in older Fromsoft titles to open plains in the Lands Between feels amazing. The freedom of engaging the world at your own pace is such a wonderful introduction. The areas introduced all feel unique with it's own stories to tell. ;;
;;
*A fantastic, intricate and engaging lore. ;;
How can we describe the story and lore of Elden Ring? Well, I'd say Early Christianity, western alchemy, Gnosticism, occultism and mysticism. The historical foundation that serves as a base for the game's storytelling has been greatly expanded compared to earlier titles and is now bigger than ever. This makes this game such a joy to unravel, puzzling together the historical references. ;;
;;
*Stunning and unparalleled visuals;;
This game offers some of the most stunning colors, weathers and atmospheres I've seen in a game. Each zone has it's own unique climate, flora and color palette that it nails perfectly. From the ever-clouded plains of Limgrave, the starry skies of Liurnia to the snowy mountaintop of the Giants. ;;
;;
THE BAD: ;;
*The game sadly plays too much like an older Dark Souls game;;
And what I mean by this, despite Elden Ring's adaptation to a more modern open world RPG, it still plays out like the titles of yore. It's a railroaded boss slaying game that offers very limited effects of player choices and world interactions. Many NPCs questlines feature interesting early stages that can be skipped altogether (Rogier, Ranni etc), without any punishment or loss of valuable items. ;;
It makes the game feel extremely streamlined as it doesn't reward thorough gameplay more akin to a RPG. ;;
;;
*Limited weapon and armor variety ;;
My favorite thing about Dark Souls 3 was the absolute variety of gear in the world. ;;
Soldiers and knights in the Lands Between all carry more or less identical gear. ;;
The pinhead knight armor having the same model across all factions is disappointing. ;;
Not to mention they all wield the exact same weapons. The Brass Shield, the Lordsworn Straight- and Greatsword, Knight's Greatsword and Partisan. A world filled with different heritages and traditions should enable a more diverse selection of styles. ;;
;;
*Low enemy variety ;;
This somewhat follows in the same track as the previous one, just as we see a lack of variety of gear on enemies, we also have a lack of variety when it comes to enemies. ;;
What truly makes an area feel unique is it's denizens. Sadly, as we progress to the later stages of the game we can really notice how the enemy variety fizzles out, and in the final zones of the game we end up fighting more or less the same enemies we've fought before, but now they have a lot more HP, defense and attack. That's it. ;;
;;
*Unfinished and cut content ;;
"First you should do when you're done writing, is rewriting""""";;
;;
Anyone who followed the initial announcement of Elden Ring probably expected what a rollercoaster the development process must've been. Ultimately, we ended up with a game worthy of the GOTY title, but in the end we can't help but notice how certain things feel missing or incomplete. ;;
A cross comparison of item descriptions from the 1.00 version of the game reveals fundamentally different lore implications. A plethora of NPCs and questlines have been cut and reworked (Kale and the Great Caravan is one example), and we cannot know for sure what impact that might have had on the original vision of the game. Will these be reworked and reintroduced in expansions? Perhaps, but remember these were NPCs that were supposed to be in the base game (looking at you Rico).;;
;;
;;
THE VERDICT: ;;
09-Oct;;
;;
Elden Ring is without a doubt one of the best games of the decade. Maybe you think my criticism of the game are silly nitpicks, but for a game of this caliber and quality I do reserve myself the right of taking these observations. ;;
;;
Ultimately, Elden Ring is an epic unlike anything we've played before, it has truly set a new bar in the gaming industry.  All that I can ask from Fromsoft is to take some steps outside of their Dark Souls comfort zone in the future.;;

"134099090,english,""Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim and Far Cry which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses, it truly is up to you with no outside influence. It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.";;
;;
Elden Ring has also mastered the art of sublety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the same with Elden Ring. It's hard to place my finger on one specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable. Many times I've gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I belive that it's each of the game's features: its combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc. that complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing and at the same time, come together in such a fluid manner that I as the player can't notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I haven't felt from any game before.;;
;;
Other, more objective factors of Elden Ring are equally as impressive--it's hard to believe this is a $60 game. The map is massive, far bigger than I could've ever imagined, with more content packed into it than any other world game I've played before. I have not had a single moment where I've felt the map felt desolate or empty, there was always something to see and explore. The combat system is rich, balanced, and rewards each playstyle. The difficulty of the game is refreshing and I feel that I'm being challenged to improve and innovate as I play the game instead of relying on old hacks. The subtle details, such as changes in behavior over time of day or cross-NPC interactions add a layer of immersion that makes the world feel alive. It is also a very polished product: while games today are released with game-breaking bugs and issues, I haven't encountered a single bug in Elden Ring even given its massive map aside from minor visual glitches. It is truly astounding how much that adds to the immersion of the game.;;
;;
"Overall, I feel that Elden Ring is an amazing game. While it isn't perfect by any means, in fact, the imperfections of the game give me something to look forward to for what will be the sequel to this, it will be hard to find a game from the last decade that is as immersive as this. I am truly impressed by From Software's work and I look forward to their next game. Elden Ring will inspire the next generation's set of games and I hope to see what comes from this. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Elden Ring and I hope to see you too enjoy it."",2023-03-05 07:10:49,True,0,0,True,False,False,98,2,10898,294,10756,2023-03-05 09:36:47";;

"134084378,english,""[h1] Elden Ring is the pinnacle game in the Souls-like genre. Building on the foundations of previous FromSoftware titles, Elden Ring is a standout title and is the spiritual successor to Dark Souls. Elden Ring comes at a great time in a nosediving era of AAA gaming, and is the best new game I’ve played in a few years. [/h1]";;
;;
Building on the shoulders of Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, Elden Ring seems to bring everything together into an all-encompassing epic which smashes the scale and complexity of previous titles out of the water. Thrust into a new high fantasy/dark fantasy setting, the player is put into a world which dwarfs the map size of previous titles; it’s full of more secrets and treasures than we’ve seen in other FromSoftware titles. Although some open areas are a bit dead, the quality of many of the game’s hubs is enough to overpower these “mile wide, inch deep” areas – including the great mage academy of Raya Lucaria, the game’s first castle in Stormveil Castle, the fiery peak which holds Volcano Manor, and the game’s central location which is the golden multi-leveled city of Leyndell. Of course, there is much more, with several vital, detailed locations spread out across a large world. You’ll find golden forests, caves full of crystals, icy fields and icy peaks, mighty castles, and great underground rivers. Speaking of underground areas, Elden Ring’s underground areas are less like dinky caves and are more like entire world spaces, complete with lost ancient cities, mighty bosses, and dark or mysterious secrets – for me, this may have been one of the most standout parts of Elden Ring. This is almost like if Zork was given the AAA budget it always needed.;
;;
Elden Ring has more quests and storylines than FromSoftware fans have ever seen, and it has several distinct endings. Elden Ring has a story that is fairly easier to interpret than past FromSoftware titles, yet I would argue it is also more open to interpretation in general, and has quest progression that is quite complex. Quests, especially main story quests, have several steps to follow, which may not always be stated explicitly. The game’s many endings each have different steps to achieving any specific ending, where these steps may run through different and separate areas of the world entirely – your only hints may be on an obscure item description, or just happening to find a NPC in the perfect specific place. When you consider this alongside the fact that a full playthrough of Elden Ring can easily take over 100 hours, it becomes clear that this game is intended for those who will truly explore every detail of the world. This game will require serious exploring, item description reading, and a deal of abstract thinking. You should know that there is no quest log at all, which only adds to the vagueness of quest progression.;;
;;
In essence, the game is a massive riddle and puzzle – whether this is all a problem or not is up to you. It may mean missing out on entire quest lines and important characters or bosses, or it may mean finding secrets which few have found organically. This notable challenge is not helped by the game’s infamously harder-than-average combat – but, for me, if it’s not that hard then it’s not even worth playing.;;
;;
Elden Ring is a darn difficult game to play through. A third-person fast-flowing M&M (magic and melee), Elden Ring’s combat system allows the player to dodge, evade, block, and counterattack in many ways, where each element must be timed very well – and, where small miscalculations can mean an easy end. While the game features some difficulty-reducing facets such as fast travel, a horse to ride on, and several opportunities to grind for skills, levels, and weapon upgrades, the bosses are still quite difficult to pass through, especially a few of the late game bosses. The fanbase may argue on who has the biggest stick among the FromSoftware games, but I kid you not – it’s far from a breeze. You must be on your toes at every second, and you must learn almost all of your enemy’s moves to persist and persevere. I thought Elden Ring’s late game was more hair-tugging than any of the other Souls-like games so far, and when it can be a 100 hour game you must steel yourself for far longer than your average game. This game is meant for people who desire a serious challenge, or at least is meant for those who can tolerate a serious challenge, although of course it can be cheesed if you so desire.;;
;;
If you want to be pushed and shoved until you’re any good, and then still want to be pushed and shoved beyond that, this game is up your alley.;;
;;
As a Dark Souls fan, it is time for me to admit that, deep down, I think Elden Ring is simply the better title now. Elden Ring’s quality has surpassed the older titles – there, I said it. In addition, I think this game is the best fantasy title in many years, and it has taken a jump beyond contemporary and established fantasy series.;;
;;
If we’re looking a bit deeper into the storytelling and themes of Elden Ring, the concept of ambition appears frequently throughout the game, which could lead to one of many interpretations from the game: “life is what you make it”. While you could look at this for the very concept of “truth” itself, in my own subjective way I take it to mean “the world is my oyster”. A pinch of inspiration followed by a mountain of hard work may get us to the sea beyond the mountain, where our coveted oyster’s pearl lies. Ambition must be followed primarily by dedication, persistence, a Spartan’s courage, and a life of tough work to get to anywhere of meaning. While ambition alone is never enough, it is the dire lifeblood that builds empires, discovers worlds, and creates new kings. It is the very thing which underpins the motivations of Elden Ring’s characters, and which powers those of any value in the real world in front of us. For me, it is like a third lung or a second heart, while those without ambition are but a kite fluttering in the wind with its strings cut off – lost, without real direction, defeatist, and will remain in all flavors of mediocrity until they are dust in the wind.;;
;;
“A man’s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.”;;
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations;;
;;
Still, this is just one interpretation of Elden Ring, when it may also seem there isn’t only one true interpretation from this game. From another philosophical perspective, I think Elden Ring may highlight a great point which is lost in many minds, especially within Western philosophy: there is not, or at least may not be, one universal truth or narrative, or at least that the concept of “universal truth” is subjective, with several coexisting “truths” or narratives happening at once. Some would probably pick this thought apart on the semantics of “is not” versus “may not be”, and moralists or objectivists would have a field day on the latter parts of that sentence, but frankly I don’t care. For me, Elden Ring mainly embodies these concepts within its several endings, as it may leave breadcrumbs but will never suggest any one truth or narrative for you. With what you may see later on in the game, you might see multiple truths and narratives taking place at the same time.;;
;;
What is “truth”? What is “free”? Who decides what “truth” is? Who gets to rule? Who enforces “truth”? Who may be free? These are many of the questions posed by Elden Ring – questions which are not objectively answered and which are left to your own devices. The minds of FromSoftware and Westeros aficionado George R.R. Martin come together in a very interesting way, and offer several competing, separate philosophies to analyze.;;

"[b] Elden Ring is the capstone project of FromSoftware, and is one of the few great AAA games in recent years. With more of Elden Ring still to come, it will be hard for a game like this to get beaten anytime soon, and it’s a great new addition to the fantasy genre.

134061047,english,Honestly the perfect souls game. I was skeptical about mixing the dark souls genre with open world , but it just works. In fact it works perfectly and add in all the RPG elements from leveling , gearing, and other additional systems along with the combat and you have a deep game with plenty of exploration. The game is massive you'll never be bored playing it and leveling is just fun while the combat is challenging / rewarding. Also you can JUMP which is huge in a fromsoftware game.

"134059955,english,""The best souls game for me by far. I've played every single souls game since DS1 but this game takes the crown for me. I've heard a lot of people have an issue with the lore and what not but I'm the opposite, I think the lore is great and the setting is what does it for me. I think this game is going to be either an S tier or an A+ tier for you depending on how much you like this style of game. The game is a souls like game but with a heavy emphasis on """"open world"""", which IMO is amazing and there should be more of this. I'm a big enjoyer of these open world games so for me it was an easy S tier maybe even S+ with the DLC when it comes out. Most people who criticize this game are used to the classic souls like experience where you just follow a set guideline and stay on it, meanwhile this game throws that out of the water and lets you go anywhere you want whenever you want. I already beat the game once just rushing through it and even then it was extremely fun. The game has lots of replay ability and some people have even 10+ replays, every time you discover something new and different than your previous play-through. Right now I'm doing my 100% play-through, meaning I discover and do every single thing the game, get every single weapon, talisman, etc. I think this is the way to go in terms of playing the game and brings the most out of it, very fun game and definitely recommend it even for the somewhat steep $60."",2023-03-04 18:13:20,True,0,0,True,False,False,77,13,3818,2194,3153,2023-03-07 06:28:56";;

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

First off, the graphics are beautiful. The colors are so vibrant, it's almost like you're really there. And the gameplay, it's phenomenal. You're fighting dragons, battling evil monsters, and exploring vast landscapes. It's like the Wild West of video games.;;

So currently I am not in the mood for getting other endings, expansions or other From Soft games. While sites of grace are more generously placed than in Dark Souls from what I remember, I still got annoyed the times I had to run more than 2 minutes and re-instate all buffs over and over and over again for some bosses. Meagre loot combined with the rune loss mechanics is not fun. Don't really ever again want to fight another Crucible Knight, Maliketh, Radagon or Elden Beast. Besides that, the game is just too long. I recorded 140 hours and then I still skipped some chunks of the map entirely. With that out of my system, the only fair grade for Elden Ring is a, perhaps weak, 5/5. It's eased up enough to motivate even me, a non-fan of From Soft games, to keep going.

;;
This title combines the best of the best when it comes to the amount of choices of play, and is probably the best place for someone to start with the series due to the game being open world, enabling players who are stuck with one thing to go to another and eventually slowly learn as they go. And for returning players, they'll find familiar weapons and mechanics, plus all new ones leading into some really interesting styles of play. ;;
;;
My only complaint with this game: Due to the game being open world like it is, it is rather difficult to continue and very easy to completely miss some NPC quests and stories. The game is still completely enjoyable without doing them all, of course, as this is the kind of game that encourages players to play it multiple times to really experience what the game has to offer, and if you're really desperate then you can always consult a guide online these days.;;
;;
"I highly recommend this game, and consider it in the realms of 10/10. Great music, beautiful awe-inspiring environments, wild creature and character design, an absolute ludicrous level of freedom.

This is a PvE-single-player-explore-and-conquer dream.  But I don't recommend it.  It is frustratingly difficult at times.  The story is non-existent.  There are no quest guides to help you navigate the open world.  I am playing the game with a 12900k + 4090 yet it frequently stutters during combat, even though it's weirdly locked to 60 FPS.  My 2017 7700k + 1080 Ti could do 4k60 so ... what gives?;;
;;
This game feels a lot like Elder Scrolls games: sure there's a main questline / goal but you can totally ignore it and just wander around and do stuff.  I never finished Oblivion or Skyrim; I wandered around, leveled up, did some quest lines, joined some guilds, then got bored and stopped playing altogether.;
;;
Elden Ring has been similar ... I'm 160+ hours in and have leveled a lot and explored but now feel fatigue & boredom.  Since there's no story development, I don't feel any connection to the world and the characters in it ... why do I even care about becoming the Elden Lord and stopping the baddies in this world?  Since there are no quest markers, I often find NPCs dead (as evidenced by them being a pile of lootable armor) having missed meeting them at the correct time.  But, I usually just shrug at this because the game doesn't give me a reason to care.;;

Is it not bullshit to be doing very good on a run to the point that you can't see red on the bosses health bar, and then all of a sudden it starts spamming every single attack it has not giving you a fucking second to react? I think it's the definition of bullshit. On the elden beast it does this thing where it shoots stars from the sky that track you and it's very annoying, and how i've gotten past that on every single play-through i've done is by running, that's what your supposed to do. But that doesn't matter. Because every single time i get it down to super low health it won't even let me avoid the attack anymore. i've been stuck on elden beast for 5 hours and without fail this only happens when it gets to low health, every other time i can get past it easy no sweat.

;;
I wanted to be objective on this review so I left it for some while and waited for my excitement to go down. Fromsoftware and their games are my favourites. I love Souls-Borne series the most of all games.;;
I started with Dark Souls 2 and after it played through Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Sekiro. DS1 and Demon Souls I saw on the live stream. ;;
Then I played an absurd amount of souls-like games from other studios or indie developers, for example: Surge 1+2, Hellpoint, Lords of the Fallen, Nioh 1+2, Ashen, Mortal Shell, Salt and Sanctuary, Code Vein, Thymesia, Death's Gambit etc.;;
The point is I love the souls like formula in the games and all these games that I mentioned are great but I wanted something fresh, because all of these game follows the same pattern. ;;
When Elden Ring was first announced I thought of it as no big deal, but man was I wrong.;;
;;
"Elden Ring took the souls formula and pushed it to another level - open world. It could sound terrifying but it isn't, trust me. The masters from Fromsoftware did absolutely amazing job in implementing all that we like into an open world. The world is full of activities, enemies, bosses, items (every one item except consumables has its own specific place), NPCs and stories and full of amazing lore that we love. The game challenges you at every corner and I thought not even once that I'm bored. Worlds on Ubisoft """"checklist"""" basis are nothing compared to the world of Elden Ring.";;
;;
"Build variety is as amazing, maybe better than in Dark Souls. Main dungeons are sweet and complex locations like in the previous games. Side dungeons are okey, sometimes they look similar to each other, but it depend on """"biome"""" in which you currently are. There are lot of secret tombs and theres questline for witch Ranni, that opens a whole area of the map that you cannot find otherway. Skills, spells, weapons feel epic and adds a lot of flavour to your playthrough.";;
;;
It's a fresh wind for souls games and I hope the coming DLC would be even better than the main storyline.;;
;;
Pros and cons:;;
#NAME?;;
#NAME?;;
+ Graphics are slightly better but nothing big, so I felt like home from the beggining;;
+ Epic bosses, even better than in previous games (I mean main bosses);;

Elden Ring is a difficult game, especially for new-comers like me, who are new to the Souls-series of games, but that did not stop my endless amazement and sense of wonder every step I took.

its nice to have alot of bosses but maybe they should have made them more interactive and make the animations as big as the hitbox. the last 2 bosses were probably the worst thing i fought in any game ever;;
;;
very clunky combat system, the animation of not having pots left to drink stuns for about 3 seconds and cant be canceled. about 90 % of the time enemy hits cancel your attack and sometimes your own hits cc for 3 seconds and there seems to be no pattern, putting on 3x better gear against cc didnt make any difference either.;;
;;
the game is not that bad, offers a lot of content for not too much money but if you play it keep one thing in mind: YOU CAN SKIP BOSSES. some bosses have such poor designs or hitboxes, they dont deserve to die. If you want to just run through i recommend strenght build, its about 50% better than any other build and doesnt even get outscaled in late game despite only leveling vigor and strenght;;

The boss's are some of the best in any video game I have ever seen and are very memorable. Any gamer should give this game a shot but the only issue on PC is some fps drops in certain areas but never in boss fights it does not bother me that much. In conclusion this is a masterpiece of are generation.

And HUGE. Oh my... is the map huge. There's just always more and more and more even when you think you've seen it all. ;;
;;
The addition of horseback riding has definitely been a nice new thing that I know a lot of players are liking. (though I didn't really mind walking in previous games);;
I also think spells are probably better and makes more sense now than they have in the past in FromSoftware games. Which is good cause I always found spellcasting to be pretty weird in their games.;;
;;
The world and its colours are absolutely stunningly beautiful, the bossfights are epic and fun and you have a massive arsenal of weapons and armor to choose from, with 'Ashes of War' to add new abilities. ;;
;;
Overall with how well made the world is and how much effort you can feel has been put into it I would call Elden Ring a masterpiece and I'll give it like a 9.5/10 ;;

The only downside I have with the game is stuff like quests are still so vague and weird like I think they have always been in FromSoftware soulslike games which is a bit ugh for me and some of my friends.

;;
[Gameplay];;
;;
- Freedom of choice -;;
Choice in Elden Ring is abundant. The game begins with the ability to select a class, each including different armor, weapons, and starting stats. Picking any one of these DOES NOT lock you into a specific playstyle for the rest of the game, they merely give you your choice of starting gear to begin your journey. As you progress, you will be able to find and equip different armor pieces, weapons/combinations of weapons, skills that can be applied to most weapons, and spells/incantations. Despite these being the basics of defense and offense, there are many other ways you can play that include things like sneaking, a flask you can mix ingredients into that have many varying effects, craftable temporary throwing weapons, horseback combat, spirits you can summon into battle, and many more. Most importantly to me, you can use your environment to your advantage such as destroying explosives, knocking enemies off ledges, ambushing, etc. Choice may also be applied to how you finish the game, as there are multiple ending you can achieve in wildly different ways. Some of these endings are straightforward and easy to find, while others I know for a fact I would never have found if I didn't hear about them. Being an open world game, it becomes obvious that you have multiple paths that you can go at any given moment, but Elden Ring does it very well. MOST OF THIS GAME is content that isn't needed to finish the story, and there are entire locations that are hidden off the beaten path with ZERO indication of their existence.;;
;;
- Difficulty -;;
"It's no secret that this game is difficult. I have played multiple games made by this developer that are just as infamous for their difficulty, and I still had a hard time getting through it. If difficulty is something you don't enjoy, then this might not be the game for you, but I suggest you at least finish reading the rest of this segment. Difficulty in this game does not vary with an """"Easy, Medium, or Hard"""" set of modes, but instead, the difficulty comes from choice and circumstance. The playstyle you choose may make some parts of the game more difficult and some more easy. I found that in order to make the game easier or harder comes purely from how you limit yourself. The multiplayer mechanics of this game can mean that you don't have to lift a finger to win this game. Doing a challenge run where you limit yourself in specific ways can make it a run that isn't humanly possible. If you feel that the game isn't hard enough, then you can subtract certain elements of the game to make it a more challenging and fulfilling game. Another thing that makes the game more difficult is after beating the game. When you finish the game, you have the choice to """"Start Journey 2"""" which bring your character, armaments, level, and all, to do the story again, but the enemies hurt more and have more HP, but also drop more runes for leveling. Each cycle that you do amplifies these things up until Journey 8, which is as hard as it gets, but you can still restart the game with the same character endlessly if you wish. Benefits of starting a new journey with the same character also include trying new endings, and doing/getting things in case you missed them last time. But if you want the game to be easier for you, you have multiple options. You can summon up to 2 players at a time to aid you or use spirit summons in areas they're allowed. You can also go somewhere else to grind for levels so that you stand a better chance in an area. You can even look up enemy weaknesses if you'd like, as there is a massive community for this game that has knowledge about it all.";;
;;
- Friends and Foes -;;
There are multiple ways to interact with other players within the game. The first thing to note is that there aren't other players simply walking around in this open world, but instead, you see messages and bloodstains. The messages are written by other players using a small list of words. These messages can be helpful, funny, pointless, or deceitful, but generally it's a good idea to read them on your journey. Bloodstains can be interacted with to show a red phantom of another player's last moments before death, which can show you how dangerous an area is. White phantoms can sometimes be seen phasing in and out of your world. These phantoms are other players as they simply play the game, and they're a nice reminder that others are doing just as you're doing. Summon signs can be placed down so that you can be summoned into another world to help another player. Up to 2 players can be summoned by the host at once, and once at least one has been summoned, your world can be open for invasion. An invasion is when a player uses an item to search for worlds to invade so they can kill the host. Red summon signs can be placed to to bring another player into your world so you can fight them. If you want a fair pvp experience, there are 3 colosseums throughout the land that have their own sets of rules to play by or choose from. Lastly, if you are invaded, you can use an item to call for help so you have an ally summoned to rid the invader.;;
;;
No matter how you want to play this game, the right way is the way YOU choose.;;
;;
;;
[Design];;
;;
- How the design affects the gameplay -;;
Elden Ring has a massive amount design elements that merge amazingly with the gameplay. The developers of this game are known for environmental storytelling. By surveying your environment, you can get insight into the story of the game, or know if an area is dangerous. But many of the design elements of the game can influence a player's decisions. I suggest that you pay attention to your environment as you travel. :);;
;;
- Music and Ambiance -;;
If the visual elements don't make a good enough of an environment for you, I found the ambiance to be perfect for every area I visited. The songs are elaborate and beautiful, and fit each situation very well. I haven't had a single issue with audio choice.;;
;;
- Story -;;
If you're a fan of lore, I have fantastic news for you. There are pieces of lore in just about every corner of the game. Weapon descriptions that give crucial detail on a specific character or location, the architecture implying the origins of a place, enemies being in specific places.;;
;;
;;
[My Thoughts];;
- My Experience -;;
I have always been a fan of titles like The Elder Scrolls, Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Pokémon, Dark Souls and such; games that give you an abundance of choice so you can play however you wish. Elden Ring to me is the best game I have ever played. The care put into it is immense, and I consider it a masterpiece. I can see myself playing it for years to come, trying new things or reliving the experience. Subjectively, it's a 10 out of 10 for me, because the shortcomings pale in comparison to the strengths, and that's how I think. Objectively, there is no such thing as a perfect game. There will always be imperfections and issues a game will have, but I can see Elden Ring as being one of the top games of this decade.;
;;
- Is this game for you? -;;
"Regardless of what games mean to you, I suggest that you try it out for yourself to see if it's for you or not. Generally, if you like open world, challenge, choice, multiplayer, and stunning graphics, I would say it's likely you'll enjoy Elden Ring. Issues that I saw from myself or other friends that played the game, it's a pretty demanding game when it comes to your PC specs. Often times a friend of mine would have FPS issues and needed to turn the graphics down a bunch, and it ended up looking pretty rough. Although lag is an issue in every pvp experience, it was especially frustrating to me in Elden Ring because much of the core gameplay revolves around timing your inputs, and any delay is a big difference."",2023-03-02 09:29:23,True,0,0,True,False,False,57,1,21925,199,21925,2023-03-02 03:15:16";;

"133902722,english,""I always found the Souls games to be a bit inaccessible, but Elden Ring was the first time I really """"got"""" what is special about the genre and about From Software. ";;
;;
The unique world, with lore as deep as you care to delve, full of brilliant design and art direction, makes Elden Ring stand out as uniquely enticing among a sea of same-y open world games. There are no quest arrows or compasses, and minimal hand-holding in general; a refreshing harkening back to a time when RPGs didn't focus on being streamlined as much as they did on being immersive. Everything has an exciting air of mystery. You have to explore in Elden Ring, and it doesn't feel like a chore or a distraction or a time sink standing in the way of getting to the good stuff. None of the content here feels like filler. (The vast majority of it is optional, in fact. Side quests are not afterthoughts, they're the core of the experience.) Exploration is rewarding here. It's what you'll want to do as you play, and the game's design philosophy is all about encouraging it, letting the player mostly direct their own journey.;
;;
Combat can be difficult, yes, but also rewarding and deep, offering tons of build options where most things feel viable and nothing feels particularly obligatory. Most of what turned me off about the souls-like genre before, was not wanting to reach a sticking point and becoming frustrated with my inability to advance. Elden Ring is full of challenging bosses that you may bang your head against, but the open and non-linear nature of the game means you always have some other content you can go do instead if you get stuck on a particular encounter. Leveling up and finding better gear is basically always an option. Elden Ring challenges, and can sometimes frustrate, but never quite enough to keep you away. And the feeling of accomplishment when you are successful is all the sweeter.;;
;;
It's clear when you play that for the game's creators, this was a labor of love. It's not perfect, but what flaws it has are easy to overlook in face of it's many virtues. If you're like me and you're apprehensive about it because of the Souls genre's reputation for difficulty and high skill floor, do yourself a favor and take the chance on this one. You may surprise yourself, and this game will probably surprise you. ;;

Becuase the first 1/2-2/3 of this game is good! Very fun, lots of enemy variety and exploring every nook and cranny is a fun and rewarding experience! The bosses for the most part were a great time to smash my head against.;;
And then i got to the Atlus plains and the game became a boring irritating slog. Almost instantly too. The bosses become repeats of bosses you've already seen, the basic enemies are the exact same as the enemies that you've seen for the last 4 areas, just tankier and hit harder. The game feels like they front loaded it with all of the exciting content then desperately had to fill in the rest of the game with copy and pasted content. ;;
It managed to retroactively dislike previous boss fights by having the exact same boss show up again, and im not talking about some random enemy demon or tree, im talking about storied named bosses that you beat and then they just randomly show up again. There are roughly 10 bosses that you have to fight only once. Out of 170.;;

Honestly, if you do get this game for a few minutes just listen to the ambient sound, the birds chirping the horses clopping, the strange dog man hiding as a tree, and the random sound of a huge ass arrow being shot at you from 50 miles away.

You're grinding a lot, you want to build your character as much as you can in order to die less and in order to defeat the boss.  A game that i once hated but now I love because you realize how flexible this game is.  You play the game how you want to play it";" you set the difficulty how you want to set it.  There are so many ways to play the game and i believe that is how a game should be.  On top of that, a very beautiful game.  Give this game a shot, be patient with it and it will give you the tools you need (literally like spirits to help you tank for example) if you choose to use it to enjoy the game throughout.

I feel like this is an awesome game in the skin of a Souls project. The open world is refreshing, the story is better told in a way to understand whats going on and you have some idea of where to go but often find yourself wondering whats around the bend. The combat for me is a slippery slope. The combat while fun and engaging fall short of feeling fair due to the balance of enemies HP pools you often feel like even basic enemies can be spongy and bosses are giant sponges and this really threw me off from enjoying the game thoroughly. Unless you lookup a build that breaking the game in some way, there isn't a great way to nab a regular weapon and feel okay going about your play without wanting to pull out your hair.

133880837,english,""After about 50 hours in"; I'm extremely disappointed. The obvious flaws of previous DS games is present once again (jank movement, enemies swinging through the same walls you bounce off of... the list goes on) but NOW there's even more jank! You have tedious ass platforming on a swivel stick goat, you have scaling bosses negating any sort of leaving, getting stronger, and coming back... you have no inspiration to explore because the boss you're stuck on will be just as (if not more) difficult when you return.;
;;
There are BROKEN npcs in this game. Example: There's a singing harpie in the lake that does piss all damage to you. You can sit still and solo him and the entirety of his guards.;;
Unless. Unless he uses one move that AUTOMATICALLY HITS (it actually puts your character into an animation at it's start that becomes uncontrollable) and one shots you.;;
;;
A random, singing, low level harpie. Has piss all stats but contains a ONE HIT KILL.;;
;;
And there are a LOT of these scenarios. Balancing doesn't exist in this game.;;
;;
"The movement issues and fighting problems could be EASILY identified by even 10 hours of play test from one human, so I'm beyond sure they're aware and just throw it into the """"Difficulty is fun regardless of design"""" basket they love to bank on.";;
;;
The game is a slap in the face. It takes away the core concepts of an ARPG, but keeps the difficulty of pretentious level movement.;;
And the pausing. Holy ever loving fuck, the ability for enemies to slow down one of their attacks at random in a string of nromally quick attacks. What the fuck? It's not something WE can do so why would you have to contest with it?;;
;;
This game amounts to 100+ hours of jank deaths then RnG'ing through moves used into a victory that honestly... feels hollow as fuck by the end. I don't feel as if I mastered their moveset and could destroy them at any time now that I have; I just feel that one of their moves didn't AUTO KO me and I happened to pull a win. I don't feel like I put the work in to get stronger to surpass it, I feel as if it's the same fight as before I went and leveled. Once again negating my effort.;
;;
I'm sorry but. Not sorry. This game needs a massive overhaul to become enjoyable. Right now the only people sucking this game off are diehard souls fans who believe that FromSoftware can do no fucking wrong.;;

;;
My biggest gripe with the game is they've seemingly made the game hard just for the sake of being hard. It seems like most enemies, especially bosses, are all running at Bloodborne speed (with 360 gymnastics, jumping all over the place, infinite stamina, spamming combos, crazy damage) while the player character is running at Dark Souls 1 speed. Gone is the challenging yet fair game-play of their previous games.;;
;;
My second gripe is the open-world aspect. It's so boring! There's not enough in it to actually explore, so you're essentially just running from one major area to another, with a few bits and pieces in between. The atmosphere and the look of the world is great though. ;;
Elden Ring would've benefited so much more from proper interconnected world design.;;

This is essentially my first Souls game. I very briefly played DS3, and barely played Sekiro, so I began Elden Ring with an open mind and virtually no expectations. I assumed I'd be in for an interesting, combat centric pseudo-RPG that would be confusing and frustrating.;;
;;
That's what I got, however for some reason, despite initial frustrations with difficulty, the overload of information that is the stats screen, and the complete lack of guidance in what to do, Elden Ring is absurdly captivating. The environments are varied and gorgeous, dungeons are clearly crafted with care and attention to detail, and characters are interesting (lovable sort ahead).;;
;;
This is the first game that has had me absolutely and entirely immersed since some of my all-time favourite single-player experiences such as Fallout: New Vegas or Skyrim. The Lands Between is an expanse packed to the brim with fun content, interesting loot, and once you start exploring you never want to stop. The questlines are interesting (though you'll definitely need some help from Fextralife), and the boss fights are straight up epic. The music is downright beautiful and the visuals are so unique, so stylized, and so gorgeous in so many different ways.;;
;;
I have tried to write and rewrite this review for months, and every time, I feel dissatisfied with my own ability to convey exactly how much this game has blown me away. But now, I think I've found the perfect way to put it:;;
;;
I put down Elden Ring after playing non-stop, clocking almost 300 hours. Wanting to scratch my open world RPG itch, I revisited Witcher 3 and put in a cool 70 hours then put it down for a reason I couldn't understand. So I put together a new Skyrim modlist, spent probably 30 hours modding and troubleshooting and then another 30 playing, then put it down for a reason I couldn't understand. Hogwarts Legacy came out, and despite my love for the Harry Potter universe, for some reason I couldn't even push myself to finish the main story. I finally relented, and came to terms with the fact that I'd just rather be playing this game.;;
;;
Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It is an undeniable champion amongst a stale genre saturated with mediocrity and tired franchises. It is a tour de force, a chef d'ouvre, a pièce de résistance. Yes, I pulled up a thesaurus.;;

;;
It's okay.;;
;;
This review will compare Elden Ring to Dark Souls III a lot for obvious reasons.;;
;;
The open world formula hurts this game a lot. A sense of bewilderment is common when you move around with barely any direction at all. You get indications to sites of grace, but that's it. When i tried going someplace interesting on my own i got stomped instantly. If i didn't explore the crevices of the vast empty land, i was under leveled. If i explored everything then i saw the same ruins asset and enemies scattered everywhere. It felt like a grind and exploration for the sake of exploration.;;
;;
"When i moved on to the """"correct"""" path, and there certainly is one, although the game nor the players tell you that, it all felt very good. The pacing was amazing. This harkens back to my previous statement"; when the developer guides you in and puts you through the curated experience (i.e you play it like Dark Souls 3), it's really, really good. When you actually do open world content, it actually kind of sucks.;
;;
A huge flaw in design for me is the way they introduce you this danger. Spoilers: There is a point in the game where you get transported from the starting zone, to a much higher level Zone, Caelid. It's very obvious you are supposed to, and should, run. So i did. I got to a site of grace and went back home. This is introduced if you enter an obscure cave with a chest at the end. The run where i didn't do this, and entered as i normally would with Torrent, i got stomped by the enemies and lost my runes. ;;
;;
Therefore, it's apparent to me that the game is made to be explored and scoured for treasure. However, this content is repetitive. The same reused caves and bosses are littered across the map and give you cool stuff. The enemies here are annoying and the same in all of them, with varying layouts. Completing these is mostly a chore you do to unlock things. Not once did i do a dungeon and find it a refreshing or interesting experience. Oh, and if you skip all these you will likely be under leveled and miss out on all the cool stuff.;;
;;
"Following the curated experience is good. I wish they had taken more steps to gently guide you in game instead so they could lean into what they do best, the """"dancing"""" with the bosses. Dark Souls 3 had exquisite combat flow and each boss had a built-in rythm to learn, with few exceptions (looking at you, Oceiros). The satisfaction from completely dismantling a boss by learning their every move was amazing. It truly felt like you rose from the ashes and became stronger by learning every time. The bosses in Elden Ring attack you so mercilessly that you offload some hits to your summons instead or just abuse magic so you avoid the combat.  The openings you gain are therefore the boss attacking your meatshield instead of your own skill dodging their attacks and abusing these openings, especially if you use heavy weapons. ";;
I repeat, the intended way to play the game is by not interacting with the boss.;;
;;
To see the anthisesis of this, and my ideal version of the game, look at the Iudex Gundyr or Dragonslayer Armor fight from Dark Souls 3. ;;
To summarize, I feel the design around summons and the bosses are poorly done. Removing summons in boss fights, if not altogether, would drastically improve the game. There is no option to not use summons unless you want to use exploits, metagame or otherwise play OP builds, and not what you find fun.;;
;;
The weapons and ashes of war are good. The combat is better with more variation and more moves to learn. The progression is there.;;
;;
TL;"DR The game is okay, but ultimately dissapointing coming from Dark Souls 3. Two steps forward in some directions, two steps back in others."",2023-03-01 12:40:25,False,3,0,False,False,False,159,6,4302,0,4302,2022-04-06 23:47:30";

"Alright, just to start off, I truly believe this game is fantastic. But to truly appreciate it, you have to go in with the right mindset. Oftentimes it seems like people hop into this game to prove something to themselves or others and then have their fragile egos shattered when the game proves to be a bit of a challenge. This was sort of how I went into the game. A buddy of mine who was a bit of a Souls veteran decided to brag a bit about beating the Tree Sentinel (first field boss you come across) at base level (they chose Vagabond, I think). So I thought to myself, """"I'd like to do that too"""". And if you've never played a Souls game (me), it's a bit of a humbling experience. However, your persistence WILL pay off. My first time beating the Tree Sentinel took probably more than 40 tries. My successful run was about 20 minutes long and I felt great since I beat him with a Level 1 Wretch. Now, I've learned to beat him in under 3 minutes. That's the thing, you just get better. When you can keep your appreciation for the game above your ego, you can have hours upon hours of fun while watching yourself become better at the game. I'm currently about to reach 500 hours as I'm typing this. Still having a blast with the whole thing. That being said, there are some definite pros and cons to the game which I'll list:";;
;;
;;
;;
[h1]Cons:[/h1];;
[hr][/hr];;
-[b]Mouse and Keyboard controls.[/b] Honestly, I played through the entire game with mouse and keyboard. It wasn't horrible, but it was quite frustrating. From what I've heard, it's a constant FromSoftware issue. The games are supposedly just meant to be played on controller. I had a constant issue trying to do charged heavy attacks. Any time I'd hold down the heavy attack button, I would be locked into a light attack immediately after. I eventually managed to fix this by uncapping my frames with a mod, but we shouldn't have to risk getting banned to enjoy the game properly.;;
;;
-[b]60 FPS cap.[/b] Last I checked, the game is still locked in 60 FPS. It plays very smoothly, but if you have anything over an RTX 3060, you probably want to see what Elden Ring can do. So I ended up playing the rest of the game at 170 FPS and 140% FOV using a mod. Was silky smooth after that.;;
;;
-[b]Multiplayer limitations.[/b] So, if you're expecting to just hop into the game and play the whole thing with your friends, guess again. FromSoftware decided that you need to craft an item every time you want to play with a friend. On top of that, you lose access to your horse, summons, ability to traverse freely, sitting at graces, and from what I've seen, the ability to parry. It's just not a fun experience at all. However, there is a Co-op mod which fixes all of those things and is quite fun to play with. Invaders absolutely hate it, but nobody cares what they think anyway so mod it up. Just remember to disable EAC. v:;;
;;
-[b]Awkward quest management.[/b] So, unless you're following along to an online guide, there's a pretty high possibility that you're going to progress passed a quest and potentially lock yourself out of content because of it. This then forces you to either make a new character, reload your save (assuming you're aware of how to do that), or go into New Game+. It makes for a unique first playthrough, but it is a tad annoying when you realize all the cool stuff you missed the first time around.;;
;;
-[b][i]Some[/i] limited fashion options.[/b] Not really an issue, but you might struggle to find some decent armor combinations. I know I personally did, but I'm pretty picky.;;
;;
;;
;;
[h1]Pros:[/h1];;
[hr][/hr];;
-[b]It's a complete game.[/b] You're not going to find any areas where it seemed that the devs were cutting corners. You could maybe make a point about some repeat bosses, but all in all, nothing seems unfinished. Some people had some glitchiness when the game first came out, but I didn't have a single issue aside from anything I've said above. Honestly, these last few years, we've sort of grown accustomed to the consistent theme of game developers who just want to release a product and fix it over the game's life cycle. ([i]*cough* Call of Duty *cough*[/i]) That's just not a problem here. FromSoftware had an idea and they saw it through to the very end.;;
;;
-[b]Amazing design.[/b] It's not hard to get caught in awe while looking around in this game. It's insane to think that a group of people got together and made this. From the boss design to the environments to the animations to the UI elements, it's just beautiful. There are some funky looking things here and there, but you can look up the lore behind them and your appreciation for them increases tenfold.;;
;;
-[b]Replayability.[/b] There are so many different builds you can run in this game. You wanna run a Bleed build? Level your Arcane and get a quick weapon like a twinblade or dual katanas. Want to just go around slicing things with a big sword? Well, there are plenty of big swords in this game. Two-handing a weapon goes a long way, applying a 50% increase to your Strength stat. Like magic? You can choose between Sorcery or Incantations, both with their own respective stats and equipment scaling. Or, if you're really hardcore, go around with a naked Level 1 Wretch and bonk things with your club. That'll teach Malenia.;;
;;
-[b]Good confidence builder.[/b] A lot of people insist that this is one of the easiest Souls games. Whether that is true or not, the fact of the matter is, the game is difficult. If you can beat Malenia, that's something to be proud of. Most people uninstall at Margit. So beating this game is something you can consider an actual achievement. Not to say it's a rare occurrence, but it's a long shot from the straight forward goals of many other games.;;

"133830629,english,""I've been an avid action rpg player since I was a kid, starting with Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast.  In 2022 and 2023 I played a lot of Splatoon 3, Monster Hunter Rise, and am more recently Playing Risk of Rain 2, Valheim, and Deep Rock Galactic.  All of these games I listed have superb combat and very fitting combat.  They feel good, they're fun, and I find all of these games to control in an enjoyable way.  By that, I mean that they have excellent gameplay.";;
;;
Elden Ring's gameplay feel and loop are very poor.  The controls and gameplay itself have offered me the least fun that I have ever had in an action rpg game.  ;;
;;
"Now, before you begin harassing me in claims that I just don't like """"difficult"""" games, I found that Elden Ring is one of the least punishing action rpgs I have ever played.  If you are spending your runes, as you should, then death in this game is literally not a problem at all and there is no reason to fear dying.  So punishing is definitely not a term I would use. """"Difficult"""" is somewhat of a subjective term, but what I am assuming players mean by """"difficult"""" in this context is not """"difficult"""", but actually tedious.";;
;;
You really only have about 3 things that you might do:;;
;;
One is to dodge, dodge, dodge, and of course to dodge again and again.  The main gameplay loop is to continually dodge poor optimized, in terms of time, attacks.  The key to not getting hit is to time your dodge, but if you play this game or watch gameplay, there are so many times when you expect to get hit but don't or expect not to get hit but do.  Ultimately, this leads to nothing more than spamming the dodge button like a madman as a go around to this issue.  And that ultimately leads to boring gameplay.  ;;
;;
The second thing you might do is attack.  Attacks are done on a controller using the R1 and R2 triggers.  The R2 trigger gives you a kind of charge attack or a slower but heavier hit.  However, as we talked about timing issues, R2 is just far too impractical to even bother using with a basic melee weapon.  It is better to get your poke in with an R1 then run, or rather, to continue your dodge-athon.  Which leads me into explaining why this is so terribly boring.  You are spending most time avoiding combat and being disengaged for one, but more importantly, there isn't a lot of action coming from the player, or combos, or effects that might compromise the opponent, or disable them, or lead to giving the player some kind of advantage due to their fight strategy and so forth.  The action part of the action combat is the player running and evading a barrage of attacks or projectiles from an enemy combatant.  Sure there are spells and you can summon pets or something to spice things up, but if you want to play, or rather, engage in combat, your access to participate in the process of action within this ACTION rpg are incredibly limited.;;
;;
The third main thing that might comprise your gameplay is using items, which would be a bomb, or a heal potion, or mana potion, whatever you are carrying with you.  These potions are your main source of healing or mana rejuvenation and you will be using them a lot to continue your combat participation.  However, there is a very very big problem with this system.  You want to make sure that you have the item you may need to use on the fly as your selected item because you do not want to have to change active items during combat, as the joystick that controls your sprite is separate from the joystick to change items, which would be your d-pad.  Now, strategically this adds excitement into what would be otherwise very boring gameplay, due to the strategy of selecting items before engaging or running away so you can switch to your mana potion to continue casting spells, or whatever, but the real problem here is that you are literally taking control off of your character in order to access your items.  The switching of items requires a letting go of control of your character and creates a back and forth of engagement and disengagement.  Monster Hunter does this too with their item system, but in the case of Monster Hunter it has very little effect on your ability to continue engagement in the battle.  You can wire bug and dive back in.  In Elden Ring you dodge like a madman, get far far away, then switch items or heal or whatever, then dodge dodge your way back in.  It's simply tedious and boring and this is because your sprite completely lacks mobility.  And,  Monster Hunter does not make you feel like you are giving up control of your character to access items. ;;
;;
In sum, there are better games out there.  The popularity of this game just goes to show that it is not quality that people desire but to be a part of the popular. ;;
;;
The best I could give this game is a 7/10 and even that 7 seems overly generous.  The combat is boring, does not feel rewarding, makes you feel gimped and weak (not in a positive way), discourages engagement, and is severely lacking in complexity or technique.  Defeating an enemy gives you no satisfaction due to anything you have done and simply leaves you with an empty feeling of relief.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.;;

;;
ELDEN RING is what I always hoped and dreamed modern gaming would become. I am a huge DARK SOULS franchise fan and I would also declare this one easily the objective best one yet through the sheer hours of content at your fingertips.;;
;;
You are tarnished. A forgotten and unimportant soul who is maidenless. Luckily you meet Melina who is willing to guide you through your journey as your personal maiden / waifu. She gives you the reins to a spiritual beast named Torrent and your objective it to defeat the Shardbearers and ultimately become Elden Lord through one of the various ways of doing so.;;
;;
ELDEN RING is insane because it's a 2022 released game that is superior to all of it's predecessors and does not feature any kind of cheapness or monetization whatsoever. It's really a breath of fresh air and every waking moment spent playing this game is true peak escapism and entertainment factor. Featuring beautiful visuals and a way larger than necessary / expected world to explore. I've always liked the SOULS franchises' NPCs but this game takes it a step further in elaborating and explaining each and every character not to mention how cool they look and how they all stand out from each other.;;
;;
The bosses are the reason to play these games and whether FromSoftware realised that or just decided to go with an open world filled with seemingly endless bosses isn't actually important. The fact the player has a map, a steed, and fast travel from the get go between Sites of Grace make the quality of life so good for veterans of the series who just want to ride past everything, enjoy the scenery, and defeat some legendarily high quality bosses. Many people claim this is the easiest SOULS game but they are definitely wrong since there are some bosses in this game that are far more difficult than anything we've ever previously encountered; the hardest bosses from past games were Orphan of Kos & Darkeater Midir, and those two do not even compare to the likes of someone like Malenia, Blade of Miquella in this game who is borderline impossible to do solo no matter how good you are. The world and it's levels are obviously easier then past games and I prefer it this way actually; because it rewards thorough exploration and gives the player the ability to choose how much of a challenge they actually want since they can seek out more powerful weapons and Ashes if they want, and get early upgrade materials that will out-scale the majority of the game, or you can simply follow the linear path and go from story required boss to story required boss in a straight line without enhancing your character too much which will prove much more challenging.
;;
ELDEN RING is a one of a kind game and shows us how far FromSoftware has come from the cash grabby low effort days of something like DARK SOULS II. There will be nothing like this ever again I assume and if you only play one video game for the rest of your life, choose this one.;;

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

"133824328,english,""[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]";;
You are are revived and you find yourself in the Lands Between. Embarking on an epic quest you will need to find and to do what it takes to become and Elden Lord. ;;
;;
[H1]The good[/H1];;
The visuals, sound and music are stunning. The world building is great: there are so many locations to explore, so many secrets to discover and the monster design never gets boring. And then when you have thought you saw everything you are thrown in another big adventure. There are optional areas in the game that you may just walk by because you don't realize they are there. There are bosses and mini-bosses that you will not see unless you look for them. It brings you back to how games used to be: explore and find new things without everything being served on a plate to you. Being able to complete the game and then realize the game wasn't serving you all the content but instead you need to discover it is great. ;;
;;
The multiplayer portion is similar to Death Stranding where other players can leave you messages and you can see little blood spots where other players died. It's also cool to see the ghosts of others moving through the world and of course you can PvP if you want if you have the correct items. It's a good thing to fully integrate this in the game as prevent you from feeling lonely. There is some PVE and PVP and with the right items equipped you can select what you would like to do.;;
;;
The items and equipment that you can find is absolutely amazing: even more when you realize that there are no DLCs, microtransactions or other schemes. You pay what you get and it works. I wish other games were still like that. ;;
;;
[H1]The not so good[/H1];;
The difficulty can be punishing at times - it's part of the charm of the game / series but you might get frustrated because you feel it's unfair. You will need to build your character and get to understand the game mechanics or the bosses will make quick work of you. Without the right tactics you will die a lot regardless whether you are a high level or not. It can be frustrating but all it means you are not good enough - level up, practise, get better and rethink your tactics :-).;;
;;
You will need to use a gamepad to play this game. I cannot see how you can play this with mouse and keyboard. I used a Switch Pro Controller and that worked great. ;;
;;
"While not experiencing bugs or system issues I got several disconnects from the multiplayer part because of """"Inappropriate Activity Detected, Unable to Start in Online Mode"""". I have no idea what happened here as I was just riding my horse at those times. Usually after 10 - 15 minutes I was able to logging back on.";;
;;
There are many extended quests in the game. You will not realize this at first as there is no quest book, tracker or even on-screen notification. As you can kill NPCs you may lose their story lines without even realizing it. ;;
;;
You will have to make choices but there is not really a good or bad one so it's much how you want to role play. Because of this system as you may like to explore a lot you will find that quests have moved on: NPCs moved to a different location than you expected or you just don't realize there was a quest at all. This can be a bit annoying at times especially when you have play sessions every few days. It's hard to get back on track without making lots of notes.;;
;;
The marker system on the map only allows 100 bookmarks but there are so many more areas to explore. I wish the limit was raised as in the end I had to keep track of my progress in a notepad. Very much how I used to play old style games.;;
;;
Why can't we turn off chromatic aberration? I know there is a mod but I didn't want to play my first play through using a mod.;;
;;
Your character cannot swim or climb I loved that in Zelda Breath of the Wild or Assassin's Creed and I wish we could do it here as well.;;
;;
There are many, many systems in the game that you find or miss. Basically, you can upgrade just about everything but you need to find the right location, NPC and items. The game will do little to hold your hand it's up to you to discover. ;;
;;
[H1]Summary[/H1];;

A large majority of the bosses contain move-sets and combos that can last up to 20 seconds only leaving the player to get in a measly hit which does a sliver of damage. So the player has to hope that within this insane, unreadable dance of attacks they don't get hit lest they die and then barely make a dent in the boss's health...Then repeat over and over again and then you have a large majority of the boss fights in this game. This form of combat feels less like a duel between worthy adversaries and more a like a toddler against Mike Tyson. Its just so tedious and doesn't leave the player satisfied for beating a challenging foe but instead leaves them exhausted and glad they don't have to do that fight again. ;;
;;
"I do recommend this game though. Its like actually insane how fantastic this open world experience is. I just think its unfortunate its bogged down by the horrendous and tedious boss combat. I don't think Elden Ring is a masterpiece by any means but its definitely the best concept game I've ever played. If FromSoftware can make another game of this same scope and open world combined with lets say the combat of Sekiro, my god would that be the game of my dreams. But unfortunately the combat drags down one of the best open worlds I've explored."",2023-02-28 22:09:58,True,0,0,True,False,False,109,1,3383,962,3080,2023-03-04 08:37:21";;

133823699,english,Honestly, this game is boring. After 900 hours, I still haven't found a reason to keep playing it. Honestly the items are way too fun, the lore is cryptic and it feels like an accomplishment everytime I piece something together.

"133799653,english,""What an absolute masterpiece of a game. Definitely deserved GOTY.";;

I have never played souls-like game before and I was very skeptical. In the beginning you are thrown in a massive world with little to no guidance and everything is written inside description notes found deep in your inventory. I, ofcourse, didn't knew about it and was banging my head around to find any useful information if possible.;;
;;
Getting killed many times by Agheel Lake Dragon and eventually entering the trap inside ruins behind it xDD (I am pretty sure everyone suffered from it). Game felt unforgiving right from the start.;;
;;
But, this is where open-word and true freedom started showing it's charm. I could just smack some dude and see if I am remotely capable of defeating them or not. Roaming around and going to depths as well as far away corners started paying off little by little. Although I was very slow at levelling up in the beginning (level 44 after 45 hours) but atleast I could explore at my own pace.;;
;;
"Took little bit help from """"Elden Ring Discord Server"""" (very nice people) and kept going ahead. Beautiful locations and nicely optimized game were added bonus.";;
;;
After a while, story and progression started to make sense and I could piece together progress map to move ahead and this is where the game began to look much more enjoyable. It almost took me 55 hours to fall in love with Elden Ring and realise it's GOTY awards. Completed lots of side quests and defeated almost every boss except (2 evergoals and dragon placidusax). Some bosses felt punishing even after learning so much and they gave true satisfaction upon defeating them.;;

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

133794462,english,Amazing game. Definitely deserves all of the GOTY awards it's received. Only complaints I would have is the horse combat and movement could use some work as well as some of the bosses having spammy combos that are hard to dodge unless you get lucky or dodge at the exact right frame. Looking at you Malenia and your water fowl dance. Overall the game is great tho. Difficult but not impossible. Probably one of the easiest games From Software has made if you take advantage of stuff like spirit summons. Still doesn't stop the feeling of accomplishment once you get past that one boss you've spent an hour trying to beat tho.

It's the dream. An open world Dark Souls game. What's not to love? Shame it lost game of the year to Bill Clinton. So many ways to play and it's fairly noob friendly while still chewing you up and spitting you out like a Souls game should. I can't beat bosses naked with a ham sandwitch like some people, but once you find a build and figure things out, it's godly. Iv'e got a Sephiroth rivers of blood thing going on for my main character and it's great.;;
;;
If you love co-op and hate PVP like me, grab the Seamless co-op mod from Nexus Mods. It uses Steam servers and a .ini password instead of Fromsoft's servers, a separate executable and bypasses the need for Epic's performance sapping spyware known as EAC. Make sure you get your steed and your summon bell before starting because you may miss them during co-op, but it's 100% full time co-op without the usual Souls summoning signs and boss restrictions. It's glorious fun. Watching your friend get yeeted off a cliff by a pumpkin head never stops being funny.;;

Souls-Borne games usually aren't accessible to newer players, but this one certainly was. Over 120+ hours in, and I'm still being amazed by this. Don't think it might be too late to play this game, cause FromSoft still hasn't released a DLC. But with everything good, there is always bad.....;;
;;

"Jesus, From really needs to stop making random """"poison"""" lakes, or in this one, the forsaken Lake of Rot. Go get Flame Cleanse me, and honestly to be true, it wouldn't be a souls game without one bad area. Actually that's not the only Hell you are going to go through. It's nice that they outsourced to religious figures, because the Subterranean-Shunning Grounds were made by Satan. Now I see myself as a idiot, but when we got to the very funny troll parkour that would lead to the Three Fingers, it made me so happy. I was constantly trying to not hurl myself off the Golden Gate Bridge, and honestly please FromSoft, it was very funny in the end when I figured out that I just had to """"Git Gud"""" like everyone else was telling me. But one more hell....... MALENIA!!!!! I'm gonna say the truth, many guides online told me stuff, but ultimately, just why. It's a GOD-DAMN SEKIRO BOSS??? Man this is one middle-finger to every From enjoyer, because along with no Bloodborne PC Port after 7 F****** Years, we also get given a boss from Sekiro, which didn't get a DLC.";;
;;
Lore is always an iffy subject in From-Soft games, because we have Youtubers that finish the job George R. R. Martin couldn't. The Only Thing I Know For Real though is that we should not have to figure out this sh** ourselves, and ultimately, my head hurts after trying to figure out why the worst bosses (Foreskin Duo) is repeated at least 3 times (separately or not). I get it, its a large game, you are gonna have to re-use bosses, but please. Godefroy (Godrick reskin) Two Godfrey and Loretta boss battles, and the same for Mohg and Margit (Not counting Morgott). At least Placidusax was cool. Would cry myself to sleep again over trying to figure out why I still suck at the game. ;;

"133778123,english,""I only recommend this game for it's adventure"; exploration and beauty is unparalleled and cannot match any other soulslike. ;
;;
However, it's combat is simultaneously a repeat of old soulslikes but done in the worst way possible. The beauty of the soulslike combat system was one-on-one combat: attack, dodge, and parry. Keeping perfect time and rhythm. This game doesn't have rhythm or timing. Just constant barrages of attacks from every single enemy barring the largest and most awkward. You will feel under pressure every second but never a chance to retaliate except for only in the most minute openings. ;;
;;
"From Software's games have certainly felt the pressure of being """"Difficult"""" and are being pressed to take it's formula and press it to it's logical maxima until it no longer resembles the original. These enemies and bosses do not feel like they are from the original or from any soulslike that has come out since, but enemies from non soulslike games. Games where the player should be able to return with equal force, but never can because they feel like they themselves are ripped from DS1.";;
;;
This game will never reach the infamy of DS2 but so many encounters encompass what made that game more frustrating than fun: ambushes and memorization. Great hard games test reaction times not memorization, like the difference between the first and second Halo Legendary campaigns: where the second involved little reaction and plenty of memory after first failing many many times, the first always presented you with tests of skill for things you've previously gone through, clearly presenting the danger up front and allowing thought for your next moves for every encounter. The first Halo respected the player and wanted them to win, it understood it was a game and while it challenged the player it did not provide a wall that required narrow windows and laugh at you for not finding them. Elden Ring feels like the Dungeon Master that hated their players, the teacher that wanted you to fail, or the backstabbing friend that never was on your side.;;
;;
If this was not a game then I would recommend it beyond exploring, if learning software engineering was a game I wouldn't recommend it, if learning art was a game I wouldn't recommend it, if being alive was a game I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't matter how hard the anything is, you will eventually get good enough at to beat it. When people complain about souls games, they're not having fun. Its not because it's hard.;;

That, and the fact that my pc cant run the game very well are my only complaints about this game, and nether of them are a direct fault of the game asides from not being cross-play. 9/10 TL:DR challenging game with lots to do, many builds to make, and hidden lore..

game absolutely tanks towards the end and is very front heavy, absolute masterpiece early to midgame. by the time you get to endgame there are very few new bosses (majority either reskins of earlier ones or 2 earlier ones combined into a duo that dont mesh together at all, the game gets a lot more linear with less interesting places to just come across and the balancing even at the recommended level is just not good.;;
;;
the leveling system is terrible. find a new area? too bad because all of the enemies are 50 levels above you. sort of defeats the whole point of exploration no? once you remember that place and choose to go back youre extremely overleveled and kill everything in 1-2 hits including bosses. ;;

Story is good and the fact that you're being called ''maidenless'' at the beginning is funny. The only down side of the game unfortunately is the coop. It's pretty horrible because if you plan to play it with your mates, it's pretty hard. While I was doing a boss (The rider near the church at the beginning), I was almost killing the boss and dodged him extremely well and played good, however me and my mate got invaded by some high level player and pretty much healed the boss with half hp). Yes you heard it right, not only the invaders are not being targeted by the mobs, but they can also use the bosses to easily kill you. For a new player that's pretty discouraging for them to even make em try to touch coop, considering that's the best part about a multiplayer, especially a souls game. If you plan on playing this on coop, I'd suggest another game like Nioh 1 or 2. It's a souls game and it may not be the same style as this one but it has amazing coop and I highly recommend that one too.

I enjoyed all other fromsoft games. To me the open world is and the unoriginal bosses is what ruined it. 95% of the bosses are really easy they are even easier than dark souls 2 bosses. Even Malenia which people claim is harder than bosses like Nameless king, Artorius, Midir ect isn’t as tough as people make it out to be. Also as you mentioned in the video the reused bosses, assets, and so movesets bothers me too. The open world really feels pointless and bland like in Ubisoft games. Souls like games works best as linear dungeon crawlers like the dark souls games. Or semi open world like sekiro. During my first run I did an all bosses playthrough I just keep stopping to play other things since I found the bosses in this game so boring and easy compared to the other souls games. But 1 thing for sure is whenever I play the game again, I CANNOT bring myself to do any of the optional bosses again whereas in every other souls like game fromsoft made I do every bit of content available.

;;
Elden Ring takes the established Souls formula and puts it in a Zelda like open world. After 500+ hours I still find new stuff, uncover dialogue with NPCs, etc. While all the elements to keep you entertained for hours upon hours are there, there is also a lot more. It's like a digital painting, a work of art. From the colour palette to the music. Even though the world is a bleak, surreal and dreamy nothing feels out of place. Every item, NPC, piece of dialogue feels like it belongs there for a reason. This unfortunately isn't always true for the side content, which is one of drawbacks of an open world.;;

"The obvious shortcomings of an open world game are easily overlooked by the overall experience that is present here.

The only reason I wouldnt recommend it is its addicting. This is my first souls game and very rarely do I have issues with it. ";;
Pros:;;
Hours of side content;;
Rich environmental and lore storytelling;;
Interesting characters;;
Open world and a non-linear experience letting you go at your own pace;;
Bosses are usually pretty fun and unique, even ones that reoccur as normal enemies later as it is incredibly satisfying to fight something as a boss and come back and beat it to a pulp as a regular enemy;;
Bosses are rarely unfair and it usually feels like your fault for dying either by being under leveled or unskilled;;
Speaking of being underlevel, leveling and power leveling to make fights easier is completely viable and legitimate way to play;;
Tons of secrets to explore and find granting new rewards;;
Cons:;;
Its a souls game, if you rage easy its not for you;;
Early game is brutal and hard and basically requires some grind or incredible skill;;
Camera can be buggy getting stuck and spinning with lock on;;
Lock on can fuck you as often as it helps you by randomly switching targets or body parts from slight mouse movements making you miss or get stuck;;
Horse combat can trivialize fights;;
Attacking with colossal weapons is sluggish but also seems to eat inputs meaning mashing can make you commit to extra attacks and take damage;;
When a something DOES feel unfair it feels EXTREMELY UNFAIR. (For me it was putting a magma wyrm in a tiny arena where it can basically take up the entire stage with one move it likes to spam that leaves lingering magma);;
Some puzzles are insanely complex, almost requiring a video making blind playthroughs hard;;
Jumping and falling on someone COUNTS AS AN ATTACK and will make them hostile or OUTRIGHT KILL some characters, which can lock you out of some quests and even endings, This can be fixed with a specific item at a specific place but the location is never revealed or explained until you randomly find it.;;
Scaling feels wonky, and some enemies will seem overly tanky despite being much weaker previously, or youll come back after a few levels and theyll be a joke;;

As an avid Bloodborne lover, good combat flow, and combat enjoyability is a must for me. One of the problems with most souls/soulslike games for me is when I beat a boss, I often feel a “ugh thank god that’s over with” feeling. I don’t get that victorious hell-yeah moment, I’m just glad it’s done and lowkey dreading the next boss that I come across. Elden Ring? Every boss fight is hard fought, but incredibly satisfying. The elation of taking down these gorgeously designed bosses is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before with any video game. It feels good to win. So good that I find myself constantly coming back to try new builds and new ways to challenge myself. ;;

133645240,english,Note: This is not strictly a negative review, but the game’s overall design makes it hard for me to openly recommend it.";;
;;
Elden Ring is an open world combat RPG, where battling with enemies is the center of everything. There is a huge world to explore where you find various items, that help your character you make in the beginning to become stronger statistically, but everything you find centers on your combat capability of course, since this is not an adventure game. Albeit this approach, the game offers some impressive vistas throughout the world you explore, somewhat curious NPCs that talk to you and most importantly challenges in the form of varying enemies and boss battles. There are many places you can visit, also underground, which all help you, at the end of the day, to become stronger by giving you more runes, that are basically a currency you buy levels with at checkpoints.;;
 If one is familiar with the developer’s, From Software, former titles, the risk reward mechanic is the same in here and the actual fighting mechanics are also the same as in Dark Souls games; you lose your runes when you die, but can retrieve them from your death spot, but lose them completely if you die again before that, and the fighting is basically careful observing of enemies while dodging (by rolling endlessly) and blocking.;
;;
The game is fun at the beginning, offering decent challenge, and at any point if you find the game too tough, which is likely, you can gain more levels by collecting runes for slaying enemies or simply exploring easier approachable areas. Since the game is very long in length due to the sheer size of the world, most players might wish to follow the main path straight to the end without much additional exploration, but alas, the game’s difficulty, even despite the help of a selectable phantom fighter (spirit ashes) who you can call in for help in tough spots, forces exploration to gain runes for the vast majority of players to overcome later tough enemies. This might not sound like an issue, since this applies to some other open world titles too, but the time it takes to explore to be strong enough is in tens of hours – I’m not exaggerating.;;
 While the beginning is fun and quite exciting, the more you play the more repetition kicks in, even if the areas around the map are visually different, but enemies repeat and so do bosses; they use the same models. Even the overall quality of level design is better at the beginning, the Stormveil Castle being at least to me the most exciting place to see and explore, after that perhaps a few notable places existing in the game. This castle is at the very beginning and after that the quality slowly drops the further you get, endgame being very tough and a slog to get through, mostly due to some nasty bosses.;
;;
The bosses are a big part of the studio’s focus and they are admittedly often fun to fight, but in this game most bosses are annoyingly designed, scaling in damage too much from the very beginning till the end. This vast damage they tend to inflict in a single strike makes the game more a hectic rhythm based act to avoid the worst hits, while waiting patiently for an opening to strike pretty much freely when the enemy takes it’s pause. I find this limiting character building wise, since I’m sure the game is extremely hard without putting many skill points on vitality (max health) to sustain more damage.;;
 The bosses also have cheap moves and combos, which often rightfully makes you feel like you die an unexpected and unfair death, but this is thankfully mitigated by the phantom helper that can take hits from enemies instead of you and even slightly damage them, so you can heal up on the side, perhaps cast a spell or incantation and prepare to strike again. So even if boss design is most often not as great as in previous games from the studio, especially compared to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, occasionally being even bad, the phantom helper is there for you making some bosses actually pretty trivial, which is not a bad thing if you don’t wish to be stuck on them in this - in my honest opinion - too long game.;;
;;
I personally have explored almost everything in the world and I’m likely ”over leveled”, which would mean that in the main progression path I’m fighting enemies on a higher level than players usually are, but still, after playing so long, easily over 100 hours in fact, I’m still currently momentarily stuck at one mandatory very late game boss that, once again, has upped damage so that it can kill you in a short sweep of attacks. This fact is saddening to me, since the game has pretty fun exploration, the best yet character building in the studio’s history, amusing places to discover, and of course the action is intuitive and most often entertaining, but yet the game is enough of a slog to get through at many points and too repetitive. If you decide or rather need to explore much because of the difficulty that can spike, the game starts undoubtedly to feel overall as following: cheap. It is a cheap game in the end with talent and quality at many places, but filler content and bad design all over the place. This game should have been shorter in my opinion, or at least easy enough to complete quicker going straight through the main path, but for me - and I’m not a noob mind you since I have completed Dark Souls 1 and 3 and Sekiro, Elden Ring is simply too tough to my taste to call it enjoyable.;;
 As a side note, I might find the game so hard due to a faith build, meaning I use incantations in the game that are slow to cast in the heat of a battle, but this fact just tarnishes the game even more, because it truly doesn’t allow too much freedom in building the character if you want to excel as care free as possible - which you want, trust me.;;
;;
Now you might find this game fun and most players looking for combatting challenge will do at the beginning for a long while, but I label this review as negative due to the overall quality throughout the experience and the too cheap and frustrating challenge you will face eventually, no matter how good you are. If you are good, you will overcome the challenge, perhaps even quickly, but I doubt many of the fights are that fun in any case, unlike in Dark Souls 3 for example, where the game is thoroughly quite carefully designed, albeit unforgiving.;;
 Consider this game if you are ready to face this disappointment I’m feeling here and in the case you are a fan of the studio’s previous work, but for many, you should think twice, remembering that this game is far from GOTY material like some might claim, because the quality is so varying. I think sound design and graphics should be better as well to call this a GOTY, since the tech is like a mix of last-gen and current-gen, leaning more on the last-gen.;;
;;
Lastly about the mentioned technical side: The game runs decent enough if you have strong single core CPU performance and my RX 5700 XT plays it almost always at 60 FPS on max settings at 1440p, which the game is unfortunately capped at, but this hasn’t bothered me mentionably. There are areas that are bound to drop the framerate below 60 FPS, somewhere around 40 – 45, which is a slight annoyance, but those moments are rare. The game’s current version 1.08.1 is bug free, though it’s worth to mention that I experienced one freeze-up.;;

"133636280,english,""Beautiful game. I am a dark souls veteran and figured I would make this one a challenge. In dark souls 3 i challenged myself by taking a shot every time i die, needless to say i got pretty drunk LOL. This time i wanted to crank it up another level. I told myself i would break a law every time i died. well this game is harder than i thought it was going to be. at first breaking the laws started out easy. I did to the first boss, The Fell Omen, almost immediately so i had to break the law. I went outside and J walked, no problem. Then i died to the golden horse guy and had to break another law, i ended up holding up a 7/11 for 87 bucks. I got home and hopped back on to try again. I died almost immediately again to that horse guy and went out to break another law. I went to the bank and took a big loan under a fake identity and leased a boat to impress chicks at seacrets in OC. well the law caught up to me and i ended up spending a year in jail. i got back on the other day and finally beat the horse boss. its pretty cool"",2023-02-26 05:15:17,True,1,0,True,False,False,105,10,10650,0,10650,2023-02-07 04:17:47";;

"133632562,english,""I can safely say that this game is amazing in all of the aspects that a game can be amazing at. Gameplay, graphics, the environment that all of it takes place in, cut scenes, even the small bits of lore that I managed to gather as I played these 80 hours, mobs/bosses visual and combat designs, the learning curve that you had to go through with each and every """"creature"""" type so you can defeat it effectively and there are many other more features that I probably didn't even take advantage of, because to be honest 80 hours is not enough to get a taste of everything this game has to offer. But I have one objection to make...only one. Leonine Misbegotten. That piece of shit. That son of a bitch. That fucking pain in the ass of a boss. Don't get me wrong he is well designed and all, but I don't think I have ever hated a boss more than that ginger lion lookin' trash. All I hope for him is to choke on a huge bag of dicks daily from dawn to midnight. I fought Malenia and defeated her in 2 tries. I killed Placidusax first try. Rykard? Fucking owned his ass in the first phase and I even forgot to have the big sword equipped. And then the second try I didn't even bother to dodge. DEAD. But that asshole, he is something else. It took me about 6 to 7 hours to kill him. And once I did I was thrilled. I was over the fucking Moon. Now please imagine my surprise when I FOUND HIM AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE RADHAN, AND HE HAD COMPANY A FUCKING ANNOYING BITCH ASS KNIGHT. SO IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT I CANNOT KILL THE LEONIN BITCH BY HIMSELF BECAUSE MY BRAIN CANNOT COMPREHEND HIS MOVE SET, HE HAD AN ANNOYING IDIOT KNIGHT WITH A BIG SWORD AND A POINTY SHIELD TO STICK IT UP MY ASS. AND THE I FOUND HIM AGAIN IN LEYNDELL 2 TIMES. AND THEN AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE LORETTA AT ELPHAEL. AND THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY MORE OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE THAT PIECE OF SHIT IS HIDING HOPING TO FIND ME!!!";;
